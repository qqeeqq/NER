 In this report, a LEA protein gene OsLEA3_1 was identiWed and over_expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the Weld conditions.
 OsLEA3_1 is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress.
 The promoter of OsLEA3_1 isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought_ and salt_stress conditions.
 Three expression constructs consisting of the full_length cDNA driven by the drought_inducible promoter of OsLEA3_1 (OsLEA3_H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3_S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3_A) were transformed into the drought sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11.
 Nine homozygous families,exhibiting over_expression of a single_copy of the transgene and relatively low yield penalty in the T1 generation, were tested in the Weld for drought resistance in the T2 and T3 generations and in the PVC pipes for drought tolerance in the T2 generation.
 Except for two families (transformedwith OsLEA3_A), all the other families (transformed with OsLEA3_S and OsLEA3_H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the Weld and the PVC pipes conditions.
 These results indicate that transgenic rice with signiWcantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over_expressing OsLEA3_1 gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non_stress) in_Weld screening protocol.
 A second lpa1 mutant was identiWed from additional screening for high seed inorganic phosphorus phenotypes.
 Using a positional cloning strategy, we identiWed a single candidate gene at the rice Lpa1 locus.
 Sequence analysis of the candidate gene from the lpa1 mutants revealed two independent mutations (a single base pair substitution and a single base pair deletion) that conWrmed the identiWcation of this candidate as the rice low phytic acid 1 gene, OsLpa1.
 Analysis of N15_375 revealed changes similar to those observed in previously characterized rice lpa1 mutants (i.
IdentiWcation and characterization of lpa mutants, such as N15_186, will facilitate studies on the regulation of phytic acid biosynthesis and accumulation and help address questions concerning the contribution of the inositol lipiddependent and independent biosynthetic pathways to the production of seed phytic acid.
 Compared with control plants, the transformants showed signiWcantly increased leaf AAT activity and greater seed amino acid and protein contents.
 Two of these lines, Os_lpa_XS110_2 (homozygous non_lethal) Os_lpa_XS110_3 (homozygous lethal), contain two mutant alleles of a LPA gene (hereafter XS_lpa2_1 and XS_lpa2_2, respectively).
 In this study, we mapped the XS_lpa2_1 gene to a region on chromosome 3 between microsatellite markers RM14360 and RM1332, where the rice orthologue (OsMRP5) of the maize lpa1 gene is located.
 Sequence analysis of the OsMRP5 gene revealed a single base pair change (C/G–T/A transition) in the sixth exon of XS_lpa2_1 and a 5_bp deletion in the Wrst exon of XSlpa2_2.
 OsMRP5 is expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds, and the two mutations do not change the level of RNA transcription.
 A T_DNA insertion line, 4A02500, in which OsMRP5 was disrupted, also showed the same high inorganic phosphorus phenotype as Os_lpaXS110_3 and appeared to be homozygous lethal.
 This evidence indicates that the OsMRP5 gene plays an important role in PA metabolism in rice seeds.
Panicle architecture in rice can have a strong influence on yield.
 Using N_methyl_N_nitrosourea mutagenesis, we isolated an erect panicle mutant, Hep, from Hwasunchalbyeo, a glutinous japonica rice cultivar.
 Genetic analysis revealed that the erect panicle phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutation designated erect panicle 3 (ep3).
 Genetic mapping revealed that the ep3 mutation was located on the short arm of chromosome 2 in a 0.
1 cM region delimited by the STS markers STS5803_5 and STS5803_7.
 The ep3 locus corresponded to 46.
 Comparison of the DNA sequences of the candidate genes from wild_type and erect panicle plants revealed a single base_pair change in the second exon of LOC_Os02g15950, which is predicted to result in a nonsense mutation.
 A line carrying a T_DNA insertion in LOC_Os02g15950 was obtained and shown to have the same phenotype as the ep3 mutant, thus conWrming the identification of LOC_Os02g15950 as the ERECT PANICLE 3(EP3) gene.
 The ep3 mutation causes a signiWcant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype.
 Compared with Arabidopsis, however, a large part of the regulation mechanism of the photoperiodic response in rice still remains unclear due mainly to the lack of induced mutant genes.
 Experimental results showed that the early heading of X61 was conferred by a complete loss of photoperiodic response due to a novel single recessive mutant gene se13.
 Wild type alleles at these two loci do not function in coexistence with se13 in a homozygous state, suggesting that Se13 is an upstream locus of the Se1 and E1 loci.
Linkage analysis showed that Se13 is located in a 110 kb region between the two markers, INDEL3735_1 and INDEL3735_3 on chromosome 1.
 A database search suggested that the Se13 gene is identical to AK101395(=OsHY2), which encodes phytochromobilin synthase, a key enzyme in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.
 It is therefore considered that the complete loss of photoperiodic response of X61 is caused by a loss of function of the Se13 (OsHY2) gene involved in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.
The blast resistance gene Pik_p, mapping to the Pik locus on the long arm of rice chromosome 11, was isolated by map_based in silico cloning.
 Nipponbare, and a presence/absence analysis in the Pik_p carrier cv.
A loss_of_function experiment by RNAi showed that both KP3 and KP4 are required for Pik_p function, while a gain_of_function experiment by complementation test revealed that neither KP3 nor KP4 on their own can impart resistance, but that resistance was expressed when both were introduced simultaneously.
 Their sequence allowed Pik_p to be distinguished from Pik, Pik_s, Pik_m and Pik_h.
 In the current study, we characterized a novel dense and erect panicle (EP) mutant, dep3,derived from the Oryza sativa ssp.
 The panicle of the dep3 mutant remained erect from flowering to full maturation, whereas the panicle of the wild type plant began to droop after flowering.
 The dep3 mutation also regulated other panicle characteristics, including panicle length, grain shape and grain number per panicle.
 Anatomical observations revealed that the dep3 mutant had more small vascular bundles and a thicker culm than wild type plants, explaining the EP phenotype.
 The DEP3 gene was identified as the candidate via a map_based cloning approach and was predicted to encode a patatin_like phospholipase A2 (PLA2)superfamily domain_containing protein.
 Taken together, our results indicated that the patatin_like PLA2 might play a significant role in the formation of vascular bundles, and that the dep3 mutant may provide another EP resource for rice breeding programs.
Key message Fine mapping of the novel thermosensitive genic male sterility locus tms9_1 in the traditional TGMS line HengnongS_1 revealed that the MALE STERILITY1 homolog OsMS1 is the candidate gene.
Abstract Photoperiod_thermo_sensitive genic male sterility (P/TGMS) has been widely used in the two_line hybrid rice breeding system.
 With multiple sequence alignment and expression pattern analyses, the rice MALE STERILITY1 homolog OsMS1 gene was identified as the candidate gene for tms9_1.
 Therefore, OsGUN4 was identified as the candidate gene underlying the xantha trait.
 The function of OsGUN4 in the xantha phenotype was confirmed by identification and characterization of new allelic OsGUN4 mutations.
 Comparative bisulfite genomic sequencing of OsGUN4 revealed increased methylation in a promoter region in the mutant, and the correlation between increased methylation and the xantha phenotype was further verified by demethylation treatment.
 In summary, we have identified an epi_allele of OsGUN4 as the causal gene of the xantha marker trait and revealed that enhanced methylation in its promoter downregulated its expression in rice.
During their reproductive stage, rice crops often are exposed to cold stress, which leads to sterility and reduced yields.
 Overexpression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level.
 The genetic engineering enabled the plants to accumulate SBPase in chloroplasts and resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature stress during growth of young seedlings.
 The analyses of chlorophyll fluorescence and the content and activation of SBPase indicated that the enhancement of photosynthesis to high temperature was not related to the function of photosystem II but to the content and activation of SBPase.
 Western blotting analyses showed that high temperature stress led to the association of SBPase with the thylakoid membranes from the stroma fractions.
 The results in this study suggested that under high temperature stress, SBPase maintained the activation of ribulose_1,5_bisphosphate carboxylase_oxygenase (Rubisco) by preventing the sequestration of Rubisco activase to the thylakoid membranes from the soluble stroma fraction and thus enhanced the tolerance of CO2 assimilation to high temperature stress.
 The results suggested that overexpression of SBPase might be an effective method for enhancing high temperature tolerance of plants.
To elucidate the role of SSIIIa during starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L, endosperm, we characterized null mutants of this gene, generated by T_DNA insertions.
 Hence, the OsSSIIIa (Oryza sativa SSIIIa) mutations are referred to as white_core floury endosperm 5_1 (flo5_1) and flo5_2.
Based upon their X_ray diffraction patterns, the crystallinity of the starch in the flo5 mutant endosperm is decreased compared with wild type.
 By the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the gelatinization temperatures of endosperm starch were found to be 1–5C lower than those of the control.
 Drought tolerance was assessed in these transgenic lines and wild_type plants by withholding water for 6 days for evaluation of the ability of plants to continue growth after water_stress treatments.
7 could increase drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings.
An OsWRKY11 gene, which encodes a transcription factor with the WRKY domain, was identified as one of the genes that was induced by both heat shock and drought stresses in seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 To determine if overexpression of OsWRKY11 confers heat and drought tolerance, OsWRKY11 cDNA was fused to the promoter of HSP101 of rice and introduced into a rice cultivar Sasanishiki.
 Overexpression of OsWRKY11 was induced by heat treatment.
 After heat pretreatment, the transgenic lines showed significant heat and drought tolerance, as indicated by the slower leaf_wilting and less_impaired survival rate of green parts of plants.
 Our results indicate that the OsWRKY11 gene plays a role in heat and drought stress response and tolerance, and might be useful for improvement of stress tolerance.
 Our results indicated an increased metabolic level in GS_overexpressed plants, which showed higher total GS activities and soluble protein concentrations in leaves and higher total amino acids and total nitrogen content in the whole plant.
Decreases in both grain yield production and total amino acids were observed in seeds of GS_overexpressed plants compared with wild_type plants.
 ALS is an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for branched_chain amino acids.
 A mutant form of rice ALS (OsmALS [W548L/S627I]) that confers resistance to BS can be used as an in vitro selection marker gene for plant transformation.
Low temperatures during the booting stage reduce rice yields by causing cold_induced male sterility.
To determine whether antioxidant capacity affects the ability of rice plants to withstand chilling at the booting stage, we produced transgenic rice plants that overexpress OsAPXa and have increased APX activity.
 Cold tolerance at the booting stage in transgenic lines and WT plants was evaluated.
 Spikelet fertility was significantly higher in transgenic lines than in WT plants after a 12C treatment for 6 days.
 These results indicate that higher APX activity enhances H2O2_scavenging capacity and protects spikelets from lipid peroxidation, thereby increasing spikelet fertility under cold stress.
Heading date in rice is an important agronomic trait controlled by several genes.
 In this study, flowering time of variety Dianjingyou 1 (DJY1) was earlier than a near_isogenic line (named NIL) carried chromosome segment from African rice on chromosome 3S, when grown in both long_day (LD) and short_day (SD) conditions.
 By analyzing a large F2 population from NIL 9 DJY1, the locus DTH3 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 3)controlling early heading date in DJY1 was fine mapped to a 64_kb segment which contained only one annotated gene, a MIKC_type MADS_box protein.
 We detected a 6_bp deletion and a single base substitution in the C_domain by sequencing DTH3 in DJY1 compared with dth3 in NIL, and overexpression of DTH3 caused early flowering in callus.
Quantitative real_time PCR revealed that the transcript level of dth3 in NIL was lower than that DTH3 in DJY1 in both LD and SD conditions.
 The Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) which promotes the RFT1, was up_regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions.
 Based on Indel and dCAPs marker analysis, the dth3 allele was only present in African rice accessions.
 DTH3 affected flowering time and had no significant effect on the main agronomic traits.
 OsMTP1 heterologous expression in yeast mutants showed that OsMTP1 was able to complement the mutant strains’ hypersensitivity to Ni, Cd, and Zn, but not other metals including Co and Mn.
 OsMTP1 expression increased tolerance to Zn, Cd, and Ni in wild_type yeast BY4741 during the exponential growth phase.
 OsMTP1 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized in onion epidermal cell plasma membranes, consistent with an OsMTP1 function in heavy metal transporting.
 OsMTP1 dsRNAi mediated by transgenic assay in rice seedlings resulted in heavy metal sensitivity and changed the heavy metal accumulation in different organs of mature rice under low_concentration heavy metal stress.
 Taken together, our results show that OsMTP1 is a bivalent cation transporter localized in the cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Zn, Cd and other heavy metals,and maintain ion homeostasis in plant.
Key message Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, ABA and PEG treatments.
Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by OsHsfB2b overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference.
 OsHsfB2b is a member of class B Hsfs in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress.
 These results suggest that OsHsfB2b functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity.
 The present study revealed the potential value of OsHsfB2b in genetic improvement of rice.
Key message An insert mutation of YELLOW_GREEN LEAF2, encoding Heme Oxygenase 1, results in significant reduction of its transcript levels, and therefore impairs chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.
 Normal grown ygl2 seedlings showed yellow_green leaves with reduced contents of Chl and tetrapyrrole intermediates whereas an increase of Chl a/b ratio.
 Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated grana were poorly stacked in ygl2 mutant, resulting in underdevelopment of chloroplasts.
 The ygl2 locus was mapped to chromosome 6 and isolated via map_based cloning.
 A 7_Kb insertion was found in the first exon of YGL2/HO1, resulting in significant reduction of YGL2 expressions in the ygl2 mutant.
 YGL2 was constitutively expressed in a variety of rice tissues with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by temperature.
 In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were concurrently altered in ygl2 mutant.
 These results provide direct evidence that YGL2 has a vital function in rice Chl biosynthesis.
Key message A kinesin_like protein regulates grain length and plant height by affecting expression levels of genes involved in GA synthesis and response in rice Abstract Grain shape, a complex agronomic trait, plays an important role in determining yield and quality in rice.
In the present study, a mutant named short grain length(sgl) was identified among explants of tissue cultured japonica variety Kita_ake.
 It exhibited reduced plant height (about 72 % of WT) and short grain length (about 80 % of WT).
 The reduced length was due to decreased cell elongation.
 The Short Grain Length (SGL) gene was isolated via map_based cloning and identified to encode a kinesinlike protein.
 SGL was expressed in the whole plant, especially in the stem and panicles.
 SGL was shown to have transcriptional activity.
 In onion epidermal cells, SGL protein was found mainly in the nucleus.
 Real_time PCR analyses showed that expression levels of genes involved in gibberellin metabolic pathways were affected in the sgl mutant.
 These data suggested that SGL protein may be involved in regulating GA synthesis and response genes,that in turn, regulates grain length and plant height.
Key message Overexpression of a new stress_repressive gene OsDSR2 in rice resulted in enhanced sensitivity to ABA_dependent salt and simulated drought stresses by downregulating the expression of multiple stress_responsive genes.
 OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice.
 Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt,drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid,gibberellin acid and auxin treatments.
 Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus.
 Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)_stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA_and stress_responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1,OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C.
 Furthermore, Os_DSR2_overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post_germination stage.
 These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
Key message OsDG2 gene encoded a novel chloroplast_targeted GRP in rice.
 Disruption of the OsDG2 would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
 However, the evidence of GRPs involved in chloroplast development in plants is quite limited.
 In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named osdg2 (Oryza sativa delayed greening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three_leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green.
 Further study showed that the mutant phenotype was consistent with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development.
 The rice OsDG2 gene, encoding a novel GRP protein, was located on chromosome 2 through map_based cloning method and confirmed by molecular complementation tests.
 Subcellular localization results showed that OsDG2 was targeted in chloroplasts.
 In addition, the OsDG2 transcripts were highly expressed in leaves and undetectable in other tissues, showing the tissue_specific expression.
 In osdg2 mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild_type level in the 4th leaves.
 Our findings indicated that the nuclear_encoded OsDG2 plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
Key message OsMPK3 is a TEY_type rice MAPK belonging to Group C and directly phosphorylates OsbHLH65 in the nucleus.
 OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 are induced by biotic stress and defense_related hormones.
 In the study reported here,we determined that a TEY_type rice MAPK belonging to subgroup C, named OsMPK3, phosphorylates its substrate OsbHLH65 in the nucleus.
 Our electrophoresis mobility shift assay results revealed that OsbHLH65 specifically binds to the E_box cis_element, but not to the G_box.
 Both OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 were induced by treatments with rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), brown planthopper(Nilaparvata lugens), and defense_related hormones, such as methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid.
 Our results suggest the possibility that OsMPK3 contributes to the defense signal transduction by phosphorylating the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor.
Key message Mutation of the AM1 gene causes an albino midrib phenotype and enhances tolerance to drought in rice Abstract K.
 However, little genetic evidence has been provided on the functions of KEA in chloroplast development.
 We found that AM1 encoded putative KEA in chloroplast.
 AM1 was highly expressed in leaves, while lowly in roots.
 Chloroplast gene expression and proteins accumulation were affected during chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in am1 mutants.
Interestingly, AM1 was induced by salt and PEG, and am1 showed enhanced sensitivity to salinity in seed germination and increased tolerance to drought.
 Taken together, we concluded that KEAs were involved in chloroplast development and played important roles in drought tolerance.
 In this study we demonstrate that rice dwarf mutants that are strigolactone_deficient or _insensitive exhibit a short crown root phenotype.
 Exogenous application of GR24, a synthetic strigolactone analog, complemented the crown root defect in strigolactone_deficient mutants but not in strigolactone_insensitive mutants.
 These observations imply that strigolactones positively regulate the length of crown roots.
 Histological observations revealed that the meristematic zone is shorter in dwarf mutants than in wild type, suggesting that strigolactones may exert their effect on roots via the control of cell division.
 We also show that crown roots of wild type, but not dwarf mutants, become longer under phosphate starvation.
 Rice plants with loss_of_function of OsSPO11_1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed.
 Although the two axial_associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type.
 Thus, OsSPO11_1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
 The OsSERK1 gene belongs to a small subfamily of receptorlike kinase genes in rice and shares a highly conserved gene structure and extensive sequence homology with previously reported plant SERK genes.
 Suppression of OsSERK1 expression in transgenic calli by RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction of shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 14% in the japonica rice Zhonghua11).
 Overexpression of OsSERK1, however, increased the shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 86%).
Interestingly, OsSERK1 is significantly activated by the rice blast fungus, particularly during the incompatible interaction, and is associated with host cell death in Sekigushi lesion mimic mutants.
 Furthermore,constitutive overexpression of OsSERK1 in two rice cultivars led to an increase in host resistance to the blast fungus.
 Our data suggest that OsSERK1 may partially mediate defense signal transduction in addition to its basic role in somatic embryogenesis.
 These results provide a possible opportunity for implementing OsAGO7 gene in crop improvement.
 Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance.
 Suppressing OsMPK6 or knocking out of OsMPK6 enhanced rice resistance to diVerent races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae, causing bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide.
 The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense_respon_sive genes functioning in the NH1 (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)_involved defense signal transduction pathway.
These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion.
 Results showed that OsCOIN protein, a RING Wnger protein, was localized in both nuclear and cytoplasm membrane.
 OsCOIN is expressed in all rice organs and strongly induced by low temperature, ABA, salt and drought.
 Overexpression of OsCOIN in transgenic rice lines signiWcantly enhanced their tolerance to cold, salt and drought, accompanied by an up_regulation of OsP5CS expression and an increase of cellular proline level.
 We generated a novel allele, termed OSH6_Ds, by inserting a defective Ds element into the third exon of OSH6, which resulted in a truncated OSH6 mRNA.
 These phenotypes distinguished it from the OSH6 transgene whose ectopic expression led to a “blade to sheath transformation” phenotype at the midrib region of leaves,similar to that seen in dominant Lg3 mutants.
 Expression of a similar truncated OSH6 cDNA from the 35S promoter(35S.
 Under normal growth conditions, the mutant exhibited short root, delayed Xowering,and partial sterility.
 Some sections of the roots revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis was reduced and the cell shape in the root elongation zone shrank.
 The results of carbohydrate analysis showed an accumulation of sucrose and reduction of hexose in the Oscyt_inv1 mutant.
 Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt_inv1 mutant.
 These results indicated that OsCyt_inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice.
 Expression analysis demonstrated that OsTPP1 was initially and transiently up_regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid(ABA) treatments but slowly up_regulated under cold stress.
 OsTPP1 overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress.
 Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that OsTPP1 triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by OsTPP1.
 The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and alsosuggested the use of OsTPP1 in abiotic stress engineering of crops.
 The CONSTANS(CO) and Heading date 1 (Hd1) genes are known to be central integrators of the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.
 The circadian expression pattern of OsCO3 mRNA oscillated in a diVerent phase from Hd1 and was similar to that of OsCO3 pre_mRNA, suggesting that the diurnal expression pattern of OsCO3 transcripts may be regulated at the transcriptional level.
 Overexpression of OsCO3 specifically caused late Xowering under short day (SD) conditions relative to wild_type rice plants.
 The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants,whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1(Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not signiWcantly change.
 Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD_promotion pathway.
 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP72 showed a hypersensitivity to ABA, elevated levels of expression of ABA response gene such as LEAs, and an enhanced ability of drought tolerance.
 These results suggest that OsbZIP72 plays a positive role in drought resistance through ABA signaling, and is potential useful for engineering drought tolerant rice.
 The nuclear localization of OsDof12 was investigated by the transient expression assays of the OsDof12–GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells.
 Trans_activation assays in a yeast one_hybrid system indicated that OsDof12 had transcriptional activity.
 RNA expression analyses showed that the expression of OsDof12 was not tissue_speciWc in general and Xuctuated at diVerent development stages in rice.
 The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long_day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no eVect on Xowering time under shortday (SD) conditions.
 In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up_regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions,whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions.
 These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate Xowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14.
 In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) strategy was used to speciWcally knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR_RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance_related gene (designated as OsBRR1) was identified by screening T0 RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54_04.
 ‘Nipponbare’) showed intermediate resistance to Ken 54_04, while OsBRR1 suppression plants were susceptible to Ken 54_04.
 OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was signiWcantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54_04) and was moderately aVected by ABA, JA and SA treatment.
 Overexpression or RNAi suppression of OsBRR1 did not cause visible developmental changes in rice plants.
 These results indicate that OsBRR1 is involved in rice resistance responses to blast fungus and mediates resistance to rice blast.
Tiller number is highly regulated by controlling the formation of tiller bud and its subsequent outgrowth in response to endogenous and environmental signals.
 Here,we identiWed a rice mutant htd2 from one of the 15,000 transgenic rice lines, which is characterized by a high tillering and dwarf phenotype.
 To isolate the htd2 gene, a map_based cloning strategy was employed and 17 new insertions_deletions (InDels)markers were developed.
 A high_resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the htd2 gene was made using the F2 and F3 population.
 Furthermore, transgenic rice with reduced expression level of the gene exhibited an enhanced tillering and dwarf phenotype.
 Accordingly, the esterase/lipase/thioesterase family gene (TIGR locus Os03g10620) was identiWed as the HTD2 gene.
 HTD2 transcripts were expressed mainly in leaf.
 Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a signiWcantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway.
 The results suggest that the HTD2 gene could negatively regulate tiller bud outgrowth by the strigolactone pathway.
The cell cycle is an important process during seed development in plants and its progression is driven by a number of core regulators such as the cyclins.
 In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo.
 Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo.
 The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo_speciWc promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm.
 Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice.
 To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate secondary cell wall synthesis,we isolated a novel rice mutant, cell wall architecture1(cwa1), that exhibits an irregular thickening pattern in the secondary cell wall of sclerenchyma, as well as culm brittleness and reduced cellulose content in mature internodes.
 Genetic analysis showed that cwa1 is allelic to brittle culm1 (bc1), which encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol_anchored COBRA_like protein speciWcally in plants.
 BC1 is known as a regulator that controls the culm mechanical strength and cellulose content in the secondary cell walls of sclerenchyma, but the precise function of BC1 has not been resolved.
 Our results suggest that CWA1/BC1 has an essential role in assembling cell wall constituents at their appropriate sites, thereby enabling synthesis of solid and Xexible internodes in rice.
Appropriate leaf shape has proved to be useful in improving photosynthesis and increasing grain yield.
 To understand the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, we identified a rice mutant nrl1, which was characterized by a phenotype of narrow and rolled leaves.
 To isolate the nrl1 gene, 756 F2 and F3 mutant individuals from a cross of the nrl1 mutant with Longtepu were used and a high_resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the nrl1 gene was made.
 The nrl1 mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild_type cellulose synthase_like D4 gene.
 Accordingly, the cellulose synthase_like D4 gene was identified as the NRL1 gene.
 NRL1 was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in panicles and internodes.
 NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated,whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant.
These findings suggested that there might be a functional association between these genes in regulating leaf development.
 Under normal growth conditions, the mutant had multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarfism, wide and dark_green leaf blades, reduced tiller numbers, late and asynchronous heading, short roots, partial male sterility, etc.
 Osg1 encodes a glucanase carrying no C_terminal extension.
 Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in Xorets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades.
 Investigations using real_time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS_reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the Xorets.
 To elucidate the role of Osg1, we suppressed expression of the Osg1 gene by RNA interference in transgenic rice.
 The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility.
 These results provide evidence that Osg1 is essential for timely callose degradation in the process of tetrad dissolution.
To understand the functions of transcription factor OsNAC5 in response to abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants with knockdown OsNAC5 by RNA_interfered (RNAi) and overexpressing OsNAC5, and investigated the effects of cold, drought and salt stress on wild_type (WT), RNAi and overexpression rice lines.
 Our results demonstrated that RNAi lines became less tolerant to these stresses than WT plants, while overexpression of OsNAC5 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced tolerance to these stresses.
 Accumulation of Pro and soluble sugars was positively correlated with OsNAC5 expression levels.
 In addition,knockdown and overexpression of OsNAC5 enhanced and reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde and H2O2,suggesting that knockdown of OsNAC5 renders RNAi plants more susceptible to oxidative damage.
 Seed germination of RNAi and overexpression plants was more and less inhibited by salt and mannitol than that of WT, respectively.
 Seed germination of overexpression and RNAi plants was more and less sensitive than that of WT to ABA.
These findings highlight the important role of OsNAC5 played in the tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress by regulating downstream targets associated with accumulation of compatible solutes, Na.
Real_time RT_PCR analysis showed that OsWRKY78 transcript was most abundant in elongating stems though its expression was detected in all the tested organs.
Here, we identified a novel rice dwarf mutant, designated as ospk1, showing dwarfism, panicle enclosure, reduced seed set, and outgrowth of axillary buds from culm nodes.
Sequence analyses of 50_RACE indicated that a single T_DNA was inserted in the transcriptional regulatory region of OsPK1 in ospk1.
 Quantitative RT_PCR result showed that OsPK1 expression was decreased by approximately 90% in ospk1 compared with that in WT.
 Enzyme assay and transient expression in protoplasts indicated that OsPK1 encodes a cytosolic PK (PKc).
 Complementation with OsPK1 demonstrated that OsPK1 is responsible for the phenotype of ospk1.
 Quantitative RT_PCR and GUS staining analyses exhibited that OsPK1 was expressed mainly in leaf mesophyll cells, phloem companion cells in stems, and cortical parenchyma cells in roots.
 We propose that OsPK1 plays an important role through affecting the glycolytic pathway.
 The sucrose level in panicle of ospk1 was decreased by approximately 84%.
Together, these results provide new insights into the role of PKc in plant mo phological development, especially plant height.
 OsALDH7 is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds.
 We found that oryzamutaic acid A accumulated during late seed development and after a year_long storage in the colored endosperm, whereas it was undetectable in the wild type endosperm.
 Moreover, lysine degradation was enhanced in yeast over_expressing OsALDH7 and as a result, content of lysine, glutamate and saccharopine was changed, suggesting a role of OsALDH7 in lysine catabolism.
 WSL2 was isolated by positional cloning, and was shown to encode a homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana genes CER3/WAX2/YRE/FLP1 and the maize gene GL1.
 An analysis of the overall composition of the wax revealed that the mutant produces a substantially reduced quantity of C22–C32 fatty acids, which suggests that the function of WSL2 is associated with the elongation of very long_chain fatty acids.
 Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel rice gene OsLIS_L1 (Lissencephaly type_1_like 1), which is required for normal fertility and the first internode elongation.
 OsLIS_L1 encodes a lissencephaly type_1_like protein containing the WD40 motif that is required for brain development in human.
 SMART algorithm analysis indicated that OsLIS_L1 contains a LIS1 homology (LisH) domain, a C terminus to LisH (CTLH) domain, a five WD40_repeat domain in the middle, and a domain with four WD40 repeats which is homologous to the b subunit of trimeric G_proteins (Gb).
 OsLIS_L1 transcript is relatively highly abundant in stem and panicle and has a dynamic expression pattern at different panicle developmental stages.
 Two independent alleles, designated oslis_l1_1 and oslis_l1_2, exhibited similar abnormal developmental phenotypes, including semi_dwarf, shorter panicle length, and reduced male fertility.
 Cytological examination confirmed that OsLIS_L1 does not affect the meiosis in pollen mother cells.
 Compared with wild type,the oslis_l1 mutant had abnormal male gametophyte formation, but anther cell wall and pollen wall developmen were not affected.
 Histological analysis revealed that OsLIS_L1 regulates the cell proliferation in the first internode under the panicle.
 Our results indicate that OsLIS_L1 plays an important role in male gametophyte formation and the first internode elongation in rice.
 These results suggest that OsbZIP52/RISBZ5 could function as a negative regulator in cold and drought stress environments.
Here, we characterized that the gh1 mutant was a mutant of the rice chalcone isomerase gene (OsCHI).
 The result showed that gh1 had a Dasheng retrotransposon inserted in the 50 UTR of the OsCHI gene, which resulted in the complete loss of OsCHI expression.
 gh1 exhibited golden pigmentation in hulls and internodes once the panicles were exposed to light.
 The total flavonoid content in gh1 hulls was increased threefold compared to wild type.
 Consistent with the gh1 phenotype, OsCHI transcripts were expressed in most tissues of rice and most abundantly in internodes.
In the present study, a rice Mi_2_like gene, OsCHR4 (Oryza sativa Chromatin Remodeling 4, LOC_Os07g03450), was cloned from a rice mutant with adaxial albino leaves.
 The Oschr4 mutant exhibited defective chloroplasts in adaxial mesophyll, but not in abaxial mesophyll.
 Ultrastructural observations indicated that proplastid growth and/or thylakoid membrane formation in adaxial mesophyll cells was blocked in the Oschr4 mutant.
 Young leaves of the ylc1 mutant showed decreased levels of Chl and lutein compared to those of wild type, and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the thylakoid lamellar structures were obviously loosely arranged.
Whereas, the mutant turns green gradually and approaches normal green at the maximum tillering stage.
 Complementation and RNA_interference tests confirmed the role of the YLC1 gene, which expressed in all tested rice tissues,especially in the leaves.
 Real_time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in ylc1 mutant at different temperatures.
 In rice protoplasts, the YLC1 protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern.
 These data suggested that the YLC1 protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice.
 In addition, OsDHAR1_overexpression in seven_independent homologous transgenic plants, as compared to WT plants,increased photosynthetic capacity and antioxidant enzyme activities under paddy field conditions, which led to an improved AsA pool and redox homeostasis.
 Furthermore,OsDHAR1 overexpression significantly improved grain yield and biomass due to the increase of culm and root weights and to enhance panicle and spikelet numbers in the same seven independent TG rice plants during the farming season (2010 and 2011) in South Korea.
Therefore, our results indicate that OsDHAR1 overexpression, capable of functioning in AsA recycling, and protein folding increases environmental adaptation to paddy field conditions by the improving AsA pool and redox homeostasis, which enhances rice grain yield and biomass.
 OsGRX8 protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin.
 The over_expression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid.
 Further, the transgenic RNAi rice plants exhibited increased susceptibility to various abiotic stresses, which further confirmed the role of OsGRX8 in abiotic stress responses.
 Altogether, these findings suggest the role of OsGRX8 in regulating abiotic stress response and may be used to engineer  stress tolerance in crop plants.
Leaf rolling is receiving considerable attention as an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 However, little has been known on the molecular mechanism of rice leaf rolling, especially the abaxial rolling.
 We identified a novel abaxially curled and drooping leaf_dominant mutant from a T1 transgenic rice line.
 OsZHD1 exhibited a constitutive expression pattern in wild_type plants and accumulated in the developing leaves and panicles.
 Artificial overexpression of OsZHD1 or its closest homolog OsZHD2 induced the abaxial leaf curling.
 We herein reported OsZHD1 with key roles in rice morphogenesis, especially in the modulating of leaf rolling, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of leaf development in rice.
Main conclusion Rice heme oxygenase 2 (OsHO2) mutants are chlorophyll deficient with distinct tetrapyrrole metabolite and transcript profiles, suggesting a potential regulatory role of the stromal_localized OsHO2 in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis.
From a population of 60Coc_irradiated rice mutants, we identified the ylc2 (young leaf chlorosis 2) mutant which displays a chlorosis phenotype in seedlings with substantially reduced chlorophyll content.
 Map_based cloning located the OsYLC2 gene on chromosome 3 and it encodes the OsHO2 protein.
 Subcellular localization and chloroplast fractionation experiments indicated that OsHO2 resides in the stroma.
 However,recombinant enzyme assay demonstrated that OsHO2 is not a functional HO enzyme.
 Taken together, our work suggests that OsHO2 has a potential regulatory role for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice.
To elucidate the genetic system that establishes homologous chromosome pairing in monocot plants, we have isolated an asynaptic mutant of rice, designated pair2 (homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 2), in which 24 completely unpaired univalents are observed at pachytene and diakinesis.
 Mature PAIR2 mRNA and several splicing variants were found to be highly expressed in wild_type reproductive tissues, and lower expression was also detected in vegetative tissues.
In situ hybridization and BrdU incorporation experiments revealed that PAIR2 expression is specifically enhanced in male and female meiocytes, but not in those at pre_meiotic S phase or in the pollen maturation stages.
 The results obtained in this study suggest that the PAIR2 gene is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis, as in the case of the genes ASY1 and HOP1.
 The study also suggested the possibility that a highly homologous copy of the PAIR2 gene located on a different chromosome is in fact a pseudogene.
 In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsMADS22 expression is localized in the L1 layer of embryos and in developing stamen primordia.
 Ectopic expression of OsMADS22 in transgenic rice plants resulted in aberrant floral morphogenesis, characterized by a disorganized palea, an elongated glume,and a two_floret spikelet.
 The results are discussed in terms of rice spikelet development and a novel nonvegetative role for a STMADS11_like gene.
 In this study, rice lines transformed with sense CDPK13 or CRTintP1 constructs were produced and used to investigate the function of these proteins.
 Expression of CDPK13 or CRTintP1 was further examined in several rice varieties including coldtolerant rice varieties.
 Accumulation of these proteins in the cold_tolerant rice variety was higher than that in rice varieties that are intermediate in their cold tolerance.
 To examine whether over_expression of CDPK13 and CRTintP1 would have any eVect on the proteins or not, sense transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomics.
 The results suggest that CDPK13, calreticulin and CRTintP1 might be important signaling components for response to cold stress in rice.
 The OsLOL2 gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 163 amino acids with two LSD1_like zinc Wnger domains with 74.
 Southern blot analysis indicated that OsLOL2 was a single_copy gene in the rice genome.
 Transgenic rice lines carrying the antisense strand of OsLOL2 with decreased expression of OsLOL2 had dwarf phenotypes, and the dwarWsm could be restored by exogenous GA3 treatment, suggesting that the dwarWsm was the result of a deWciency in bioactive gibberellin (GA).
 Sense transgenic lines with increased expression of OsLOL2 were more resistant to rice bacterial blight, while antisense transgenic lines were less resistant to rice bacterial blight.
These data suggest that OsLOL2 is involved in rice growth and disease resistance.
 This spontaneous mutation of nal7 occurred during the process of developing advanced backcrossed progeny derived from crosses of rice varieties with wild type leaf phenotype.
 The NAL7 locus encodes a Xavin_containing monooxygenase, which displays sequence homology with YUCCA.
 Inspection of a structural model of NAL7 suggests that the mutation results in an inactive enzyme.
 The IAA content in the nal7 mutant was altered compared with that of wild type.
 The nal7 mutant overexpressing NAL7 cDNA exhibited overgrowth and abnormal morphology of the root, which was likely to be due to auxin overproduction.
These results indicate that NAL7 is involved in auxin biosynthesis.
 Since the ‘green revolution,’ sd1 has been extensively used to produce modern semi_dwarf varieties.
 Degradation of the SLR1 protein in these mutants occurred later than in the wild type.
 Reduced interaction abilities of the SLR1 protein in these mutants with GID1 were also observed using the yeast two_hybrid system.
 It is a type of post_zygotic reproductive isolation in which sterility and weakness are manifested in the F2 and later generations.
 Fine mapping of hbd2 resulted in the identification of the causal gene as casein kinase I (CKI1).
The transcription factor OsNAC5 in rice is a member of the plant_speciWc NAC family that regulates stress responses.
 Expression of OsNAC5 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid.
 Transactivation assays using rice protoplasts demonstrated that OsNAC5 is a transcriptional activator, and subcellular localization studies using OsNAC5_GFP fusion proteins showed that it is localized to the nucleus.
 Pull_down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1.
 To analyze the function of OsNAC5 in rice plants, we generated transgenic plants that overexpressed OsNAC5.
By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter.
 Collectively, our results indicate that the stress_responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stressinducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the eVects of these proteins on growth are diVerent.
 Furthermore, because OsNAC5 overexpression did not retard growth, OsNAC5 may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without aVecting its growth.
 The Decrease in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1) of Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the best characterized plant epigenetic regulators that are necessary for maintenance of cytosine methylation in genomic DNA.
 In this study, we identified two rice genes with similarity to Arabidopsis DDM1 and designated them OsDDM1a and OsDDM1b.
 Transgenic rice lines expressing the OsDDM1a cDNA in the antisense orientation exhibited genomic DNA hypomethylation.
 In the present study, we isolated the OsCAX4 gene and showed that its encoded protein possesses a unique transmembrane structure and is potentially involved in transporting not only Ca2+ but also Mn2+ and Cu2+.
 For example, OsCAX4 showed abundant expression in IR29 (sensitive) upon prolonged salt stress.
Upon salt stress, only OsACA4 showed first a decrease in its expression in Pokkali (tolerant), followed by a significant increase.
 The mRNA expression level of OsHARP was up_regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA.
 Rice plants transformed with the OsHARP promoter_GUS construct showed GUS staining in the basal parts of leaf sheaths, and although GUS activity increased when treated with GA3, it was not as high an increase as when mRNA was analyzed.
 To elucidate the role of OsHARP in leaf sheath elongation, antisense OsHARP transgenic rice lines were constructed.
 The antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were consistently shorter than the vector control under normal conditions.
 To examine whether OsHARP expression would affect other proteins, basal leaf sheaths from antisense OsHARP transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomic techniques.
 In antisense transgenic_rice OsHARP plants,OsCRT was down_regulated and the levels of 20 other proteins were changed compared to the pattern of the vector control.
 These results signify an important role of HARP in rice leaf sheath cell division or elongation and suggest that CRT may interact with HARP during certain stages of development.
 These results demonstrate that OsATG10b plays an important role in the survival of rice cells against oxidative stresses.
The OsAsr1 cDNA clone was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from developing seed coats of rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 Low_temperature stress increased mRNA levels of OsAsr1 in both vegetative and reproductive organs.
In situ analysis showed that OsAsr1 transcript was preferentially accumulated in the leaf mesophyll tissues and parenchyma cells of the palea and lemma.
 For transgenic rice plants that over_expressed full_length OsAsr1 cDNA in the sense orientation, the Fv/Fm values for photosynthetic efficiency were about 2_fold higher than those of wild type_segregating plants after a 24_h cold treatment.
 Interestingly, OsAsr1 was highly expressed in transgenic rice plants expressing the C_repeat/dehyhdration responsive element binding factor 1 (CBF1), suggesting the regulation of OsAsr1 by CBF1.
 Taken together, we suggest that OsAsr1 gene play an important role during temperature stress, and that this gene can be used for generating plants with enhanced cold tolerance.
We previously isolated the OsCBT gene, which encodes a calmodulin (CaM)_binding protein, from a rice expression library constructed from fungal elicitor_treated rice suspension cells.
 In order to understand the function of OsCBT in rice, we isolated and characterized a T_DNA insertion mutant allele named oscbt_1 .
 The oscbt_1 mutant exhibits reduced levels of OsCBT transcripts and no significant morphological changes compared to wild_type plant although the growth of the mutant is stunted.
 The growth of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, as well as the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae was significantly suppressed in oscbt_1  plants.
 OsCBT expression was induced upon challenge with fungal elicitor.
 Taken together, the results support an idea that OsCBT might act as a negative regulator on plant defense.
 We had previously reported upregulation of the OsACDR1 transcript by a range of environmental stimuli involved in eliciting defense_related pathways.
 Here we apply biochemical, gain and loss_of_function approaches to characterize OsACDR1 function in rice.
 The OsACDR1 protein showed autophosphorylation and possessed kinase activity.
 Rice plants overexpressing OsACDR1 exhibited spontaneous hypersensitive response (HR)_like lesions on leaves, upregulation of defense_related marker genes and accumulation of phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites (phytoalexins).
 In contrast, loss_of_function and RNA silenced OsACDR1 rice mutant plants showed downregulation of defense_related marker genes expressions and susceptibility to M.
 To investigate its transport in rice, we characterized OsZIP8, a rice ZIP (Zrt, Irt_like Protein) gene that is strongly up_regulated in shoots and roots under Zn deficiency.
 OsZIP8 could complement the growth defect of Zn_uptake yeast mutant.
 The OsZIP8_GFP fusion proteins were localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting that OsZIP8 is a plasma membrane zinc transporter in rice.
 Altogether, these results demonstrate that OsZIP8 is a zinc transporter that functions in Zn uptake and distribution.
 Exposure to high concentrations of NaCl or mannitol effected a rapid and transient enhancement of OsCIPK31 expression.
 However, longer exposure to most stresses resulted in downregulation of OsCIPK31 expression in both the presence and absence of light.
 To determine the physiological roles of OsCIPK31 in rice plants, the sensitivity of oscipk31.
 Cellular levels of ROS in osldc_like 1 leaves were significantly lower than those in the wild_type (WT) rice after exposure to oxidative, high salt and acid stresses.
 Thus, mutation of OsLDC_like 1 conferred an oxidative stress_tolerant phenotype.
 OsASR1 and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively.
 Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis_acting elements upstream of  OsASR1 and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals.
 The results of quantitative real_time PCR analyses of OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression under various conditions further support this model.
 The expression of both OsASR1 and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice.
 OsASR1 transcription was highly induced by ABA, whereas OsASR3 transcription was strongly induced by GA.
 In addition, OsASR1 and OsASR3 expression was significantly induced by sucrose and sucrose/glucose treatments, respectively.
e, OsASR1 in leaves and OsASR3 in roots).
 Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress.
A dwarf mutant (Oryza sativa anaphase_promoting complex 6 (OsAPC6)) of rice cultivar Basmati 370 with 50% reduced plant height as compared to the wild type was isolated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens_mediated transformation using HmR Ds cassette.
Homozygous mutant plants showed incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity for plant height and pleiotropic effects including gibberellic acid insensitivity, reduced seed size, panicle length, and female fertility.
 Single copy insertion of T_DNA and its association with OsAPC6 was confirmed by Southern hybridization, germination on hygromycin, and 3.
Overexpression of OsPHR2 increases phosphate (Pi) uptake and causes overaccumulation of Pi in rice plants,which is toxic to rice plants when they are grown in media with a sufficient Pi supply.
 The toxicity that results from OsPHR2 overexpression can be significantly relieved by growing the plants in a waterlogged paddy field.
The yeast one_hybrid assay indicated that OsDREB1E,OsDREB1G, and OsDREB2B can specifically bind to the C_repeat/DRE element.
 Transgenic rice plants analysis revealed that over_expression of OsDREB1G and OsDREB2B in rice significantly improved their tolerance to water deficit stress, while over_expression of OsDREB1E could only slightly improved the tolerance to water deficit stress, suggesting that the OsDREBs might participate in the stress response pathway in different manners.
Since the OsEREBP1_like gene EBL1 (OsEREBP1_LIKE 1) was significantly downregulated in phyAphyBphyC mutants, EBL1 was suspected to repress ACO1 expression in wild_type plants.
 However, ACO1 was downregulated in EBL1 RNA interference plants,and the total length of these plants was slightly shorter than that of wild_type plants.
 This study shows that EBL1 is positively regulated by phytochrome B and associated with ACO1 upregulation.
Rice (Oryza sativa) has the potential to undergo rapid internodal elongation which determines plant height.
 Gibberellin is involved in internode elongation.
 In the present study, differences in ectopic expression of LRK1 were consistent with extent of rice internode elongation.
 Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down_regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent_kaurene oxidase.
 Of these, OsGPX1 and OsGPX4 are located in mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively.
 To understand the role of these GPX in rice, the effect of knockdown of OsGPX1 and OsGPX4 in rice plants was evaluated.
 Our data show that OsGPX4 was essential for in vitro rice regeneration because no plants were obtained from calli carrying a hairpin construct against OsGPX4.
 Although the knockdown of OsGPX1 did not impair plant regeneration, the plants with silenced OsGPX1 (GPX1s plants) showed reduced shoot length and a reduced number of seeds compared to the non_transformed rice plants.
 These results indicate that OsGPX1 and OsGPX4 are essential for redox homeostasis which leads to normal growth and development in rice.
 To investigate the function of RRM domain, fragment RRM1 and RRM2 of rFCA were introduced into rice subspecies Oryza sativa L.
 Two transgenic lines exhibited similar phenotypes, flowering time delay, seed size and cell volume of transgenic plants was increased.
Rice xylanase inhibitor RIXI is a XIP_type inhibitor that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18), which includes plant class III chitinases (EC 3.
 The aim of this study was to elucidate whether RIXI had any effect on rice endoxylanase and its role(s) in plant defence.
 RIXI encoding sequence was cloned from rice (Oryza sativa cv.
The activity of recombinant RIXI was investigated–among the tested xylanases, the GH11 xylanase from Aspergillus niger was the most inhibited, while rice endogenous xylanase OSX was least inhibited.
 Semiquantitative real_time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)and quantitative real_time PCR showed that the xylanase inhibitor gene RIXI was up_regulated in rice seedlings infected by Magnaporthe grisea.
 The increased RIXI expression was also accompanied by significantly elevated expression of pathogenesis_related protein gene(PR_1) and class III chitinase gene (Cht_3).
 This suggested that RIXI might be involved in environmental responses such as defense against phytopathogens.
 Using a large F2 population derived from a cross between the d89 and a japonica rice variety, Taigeng16, the D89 gene was fine mapped into a 62.
 Sequence analysis indicated that only one bp substitution (A_G) was found in LOC_Os05g26890 between M804 and the d89 mutant.
A lesion_mimic phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa L, spotted leaf 5 (spl5) indicates that wild_type SPL5 negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses.
 Previously, the spl5 gene was already mapped to the 80_kb region between two markers SSR7 and RM7121 through a map_based cloning approach.
 Here, we further showed that the spl5 gene was delimitated into a 15.
Subsequent sequencing in this region of spl5 mutant revealed that one candidate gene harbored a singlebase deletion, resulting in a frame_shift mutation and  premature stop codon.
 Bioinformatic analysis showed that SPL5 gene encodes a putative splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3b3) and might be involved in splicing reactions of pre_mature RNAs participating in the regulation of cell death and resistance responses.
Further analysis showed that wild_type SPL5 did functionally complement the spl5 phenotype.
 The data presented here clearly indicate that the SPL5 negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses via modulating RNA splicing in plants.
 Sequencing of these candidates together with checking rice genome annotations and expression databases allowed the target to be narrowed down to one candidate gene already isolated and characterized as the tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR) gene and reported to be involved in tapetal programmed cell death.
 Histological characterization of anther development in MS IR36 revealed defects identical to the ones observed in mutants used for the isolation and characterization of the TDR gene.
The plant height and grain length of d1352 decreased by 66 and 36 %, respectively, compared with those of wild_type (WT) rice.
 Analysis using exogenous gibberellin (GA) and BR treatment showed that d1352 had normal sensitivity to GA but had reduced sensitivity to BR treatment compared with the WT.
 The mutant gene d1352 was located in a 98_kb region on rice chromosome 3 by employing a map_based cloning strategy.
 In conclusion, D1352 has an important function in the BR signaling pathway.
Bacterial leaf streak of rice (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzicola (Xoc) is a widely_spread disease in the main rice_producing areas of the world.
 DEPG1 is a nucleotide_binding site (NBS)_leucine rich repeat (LRR) gene, and the deduced protein sequence of DEPG1 has approximately 64% identity with that of the disease resistance gene Pi37.
 Phylogenetic analysis of DEPG1 and the 18 characterized NBS_LRR genes revealed that DEPG1 is more closely related to Pi37.
 DEPG1 protein is located to the cytoplasm, which was confirmed by transient expression of DEPG1_GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion construct in onion epidermal cells.
 Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that DEPG1 is widely expressed in rice, and is preferentially expressed in internodes, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and flag leaves.
 In this work, we report the genetic analysis and phenotypic characterization of mutants in OsVPS22 gene, which encodes a functional VPS22 homolog in rice.
 On the basis of a collection of T_DNA lines, we identified a T_DNA insertion mutant,which showed abnormal segregation ratios; we then found that the T_DNA insertion is located within the sixth intron of the OsVPS22 gene.
 Compared with the wild type, this vps22 mutant exhibited seedling lethality and severe reduction in shoot and root growth.
 In summary,our data suggest that OsVPS22 may be required for seedling viability and grain filling in rice, thus providing a valuable resource for further exploration of the functions of the ESCRTing machinery in plants.
Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzicola (Xoc) is an important disease of rice, which is responsible for the economic losses worldwide.
 Here, we show that one of DEPGs designated NRRB plays a role in rice–Xoc interactions.
 These data suggest that NRRB is involved in stress responses.
 In conclusion, NRRB gene is involved in various stress responses and regulating resistance to BLS, therefore it might be one of useful genes for rice improvement in future.
 Recently, a full_length cDNA encoding OsCDPK13 from rice seedling was isolated.
 OsCDPK13 accumulated in 2_week_old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA).
 OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were up_regulated in response to GA3 treatment, but suppressed in response to abscisic acid and brassinolide.
 Antisense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of OsCDPK13 was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type.
 Furthermore, OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold,but suppressed under salt and drought stresses.
 Sense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice.
 The expression of OsCDPK13 was stronger in cold_tolerant rice varieties than in cold_sensitive ones.
 The results suggest that OsCDPK13 might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress.
Fructose_bisphosphate aldolase is a glycolytic enzyme whose activity increases in rice roots treated with gibberellin (GA).
 To investigate the relationship between aldolase and root growth, GA_induced root aldolase was characterized.
 GA3 promoted an increase in aldolase accumulation when 0.
 Aldolase accumulated abundantly in roots, especially in the apical region.
To examine the effect of aldolase function on root growth, transgenic rice plants expressing antisense aldolase were constructed.
 Root growth of aldolase_antisense transgenic rice was repressed compared with that of the vector control transgenic rice.
 Although aldolase activity increased by 25% in vector control rice roots treated with 0.
 Furthermore, aldolase co_immunoprecipitated with antibodies against vacuolar Hþ_ATPase in rice roots.
 In the root of OsCDPK13_antisense transgenic rice, aldolase did not accumulate even after treatment with GA3.
 These results suggest that the activation of glycolytic pathway function accelerates root growth and that GA3_induced root aldolase may be modulated through OsCDPK13.
 Aldolase physically associates with vacuolar Hþ_ATPase in roots and may regulate the vacuolar Hþ_ATPase mediated control of cell elongation that determines root length.
 Silencing of OsDR8 using an RNA interference approach resulted in phenotypic alteration of the plants.
 The transgenic plants with repressed expression of OsDR8 showed reduced resistance or susceptibility to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae and Magnaporthe grisea causing bacterial blight and blast, which are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide, respectively.
 The putative product of OsDR8 was highly homologous to an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the thiazole precursor of thiamine.
 Transgenic plants showing repressed expression of OsDR8 and reduced resistance had significantly lower levels of thiamine than the control plants.
 These results suggest that the impact of OsDR8 on disease resistance in rice may be through the regulation of expression of other defense_responsive genes and the site of OsDR8 function is on the upstream of the signal transduction pathway.
 In addition, the accumulation of thiamine may be essential for bacterial blight resistance and blast resistance.
In yeast, Rad21/Scc1 and its meiotic variant Rec8 are key players in the establishment and subsequent dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion for mitosis and meiosis, respectively, which are essential for chromosome segregation.
 Here we describe our analysis of the function of OsRAD21_4 by RNAi.
 Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the deficient lines were defective in homologous pairing and cohesion at sister chromatid arms.
 These observations suggest that OsRad21_4 is essential for efficient meiosis.
 Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3_1 mutant.
 The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene.
 OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1_aminocyclopropane_1_carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants.
 These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.
 The locus for the mutant phenotype is bel for 8077S and bsl for Norin8m.
 The wild_type Bel gene encodes a novel cytochrome P450 monooxgenase, named CYP81A6.
Introduction of the wild_type Bel gene rescued the bentazon_ and sulfonylurea_sensitive phenotype of bela mutant.
 On the other hand, expression of antisense Bel in W6154S induced a mutant phenotype.
 Based on these results we conclude that the novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP81A6 encoded by Bel confers resistance to two different classes of herbicides.
 Rice Chl1 and Chl9 genes were mapped to chromosome 3 and isolated by mapbased cloning.
 A missense mutation occurred in a highly conserved amino acid of ChlD in the chl1 mutant and ChlI in the chl9 mutant.
 In the seedlings fed with aminolevulinate_dipyridyl in darkness, MgProto levels in the chl1 and chl9 mutants decreased up to 25% and 31% of that in wildtype, respectively, indicating that the Mg_chelatase activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in chlorophyll synthesis.
 Furthermore,Northern blot analysis indicated that the nuclear genes encoding the three subunits of Mg_chelatase and LhcpII in chl1 mutant are expressed about 2_fold higher than those in WT, but are not altered in the chl9 mutant.
Gibberellins (GAs) are a class of phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development processes including stem elongation,flowering, and seed germination.
 OsGAE1 expressed in a dose_ and time course_dependent manner with minimum expression at 1 lM GA3 and maximum expression at 50 lM GA3 starting from 30 min and peaked at 24 h after GA3 treatment.
 OsGAE1 expression was up_regulated by GA3 at transcript level while no significant effect was observed for other hormones.
 OsGAE1 was expressed in Escherichia coli with N_terminal His6 tag and the recombinant protein migrated at 38 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted 29 kDa, during SDS_PAGE.
 OsGAE1 expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root.
 In situ hybridization and OsGAE1 promoter analysis revealed that OsGAE1 expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves.
 Northern blot, Western blot, and GUS activities revealed that OsGAE1 is up_regulated by GA3.
 Transgenic rice expressing OsGAE1 in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth.
 These results suggest that OsGAE1 is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA3 and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA_regulated growth and development of rice.
 RTS is a unique gene in the rice genome.
 RNA blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicates that this gene is predominantly expressed in the anther’s tapetum during meiosis and disappears before anthesis.
 RTS has no introns and encodes a putative polypeptide of 94 amino acids with a hydrophobic N_terminal region.
 Several other sequence motifs found in other anther_specific promoters were also identified in the promoter of the RTS gene.
 Transgenic and antisense RNA approaches revealed that RTS gene is required for male fertility in rice.
 The promoter region of RTS, when fused to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease gene, barnase, or the antisense of the RTS gene, is able to drive tissue_specific expression of both genes in rice, creeping bentgrass(Agrostis stolonifera L, and Arabidopsis, conferring male sterility to the transgenic plants.
 Light and nearinfrared confocal microscopy of cross_sections through developing flowers of male_sterile transgenics shows that tissue_specific expression of barnase or the antisense RTS genes interrupts tapetal development,resulting in deformed non_viable pollen.
 These results demonstrate a critical role of the RTS gene in pollen development in rice and the versatile application of the RTS gene promoter in directing anther_specific gene expression in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, pointing to a potential for exploiting this gene and its promoter for engineering male sterility for hybrid production of various plant species.
A lesion mimic mutant that we designated Spotted leaf 18 (Spl18) was isolated from 13,000 activation_tagging lines of rice produced by our modified activation_tagging vector and further characterized.
Lesion mimic and blast resistance phenotypes were detected in the transgenic lines produced, clearly indicating that overexpression of OsAT1 caused the Spl18 phenotypes.
ADP_glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes the first committed step of starch biosynthesis in higher plants.
 In contrast, two isoforms, SSU OsAGPS2b which is a product of a seed_specific transcript of OsAGPS2, and LSU OsAGPL2, are localized in the cytosol.
 Analysis of osagps2 and osagpl2 mutants revealed that a lesion of one of the two cytosolic isoforms, OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b, causes a shrunken endosperm due to a remarkable reduction in starch synthesis.
 In leaves,however, only the osagps2 mutant appears to severely reduce the transitory starch content.
 Interestingly, the osagps2 mutant was indistinguishable from wild type during vegetative plant growth.
 Western blot analysis of the osagp mutants and wild type plants demonstrated that OsAGPS2a is an SSU isoform mainly present in leaves, and that OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 are the major SSU and LSU isoforms, respectively, in the endosperm.
 Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach.
 The OsDMC1–RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility.
 The sterility phenotypes were associated with down_regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi.
 Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock_down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression.
 Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments revealed that the OsDMC1–RNAi lines were defective in homologous pairing.
 These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing.
 In addition to its important role in diverse fundamental processes, indole_3_acetic acid (IAA) is involved in root growth and development.
 Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T_DNA_inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios.
 When oscow1 seedlings are grown under low_intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled_leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated.
 For comparison, in such conditions, the transpiration rate for WT leaves decreases approx.
 Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water_deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio.
 The gene responsible for this GUS_positive phenotype was revealed by inverse PCR as OsGSK1 (Oryza sativa glycogen synthase kinase3_like gene 1), a member of the plant GSK3/SHAGGY_like protein kinase genes and an orthologue of the Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2), AtSK21.
 Northern blot analysis showed that OsGSK1 was most highly detected in the developing panicles, suggesting that its expression is developmental stage specific.
 Knockout (KO) mutants of OsGSK1 showed enhanced tolerance to cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses when compared with non_transgenic segregants (NT).
 Overexpression of the full_length OsGSK1 led to a stunted growth phenotyp imilar to the one observed with the gain_of_function BIN/AtSK21 mutant.
 This suggests that OsGSK1 might be a functional rice orthologue that serves as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR)_signaling.
 Therefore, we propose that stress_responsive OsGSK1 may have physiological roles in stress signal_transduction pathways and floral developmental processes.
 RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV_B radiation.
 The transient expression analysis of the OsWRKY89–eGFP reporter in onion epidermal cells revealed that OsWRKY89 was targeted to nuclei.
 Transcriptional activity assays of OsWRKY89 and its mutants fused with a GAL4 DNA binding domain indicated that the 67 C_terminal amino acids were required for the transcriptional activation and that the leucine zipper region at the N_terminus enhanced its transcriptional activity.
 Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length.
 Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi_mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines.
Interestingly, overexpression of the OsWRKY89 gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white_backed planthopper as well as tolerance to UV_B irradiation.
 These results suggest that OsWRKY89 plays an important role in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
 Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized.
 Over_expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi_dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3.
 The over_expression plants accumulated elevated levels of bioactive GA, while the GA catabolic gene GA2ox3 was upregulated in the transgenic plants.
 In addition, over_expression of Oshox4 blocked GA_dependent a_amylase production.
 However, down_regulation of Oshox4 in RNAi transgenic plants induced no phenotypic alteration.
 Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over_expressing plants.
 One_hybrid assays showed that Oshox4 could interact with YAB1 promoter in yeast.
 In addition, Oshox4 expression was upregulated by GA.
 These data together suggest that Oshox4 may be involved in the negative regulation of GA signalling and may play a role to fine tune GA responses in rice.
 In this study, we screened 4416 lab_created T1 rice T_DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens.
 Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma.
 RT_PCR analyses indicated the transcription level of target candidate gene, DH1, decreased significantly in dh1 mutant.
 RNAi aimed at DH1 in wild type plants could partially result in the mutation phenotype of dh1.
 OsiSAP8 is a multiple stress inducible gene, induced by various stresses, namely heat, cold, salt, desiccation, submergence,wounding, heavy metals as well as stress hormone Abscisic acid.
 OsiSAP8 protein fused to GFP was localized towards the periphery of the cells in the epidermal cells of infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves.
 Yeast two hybrid analysis revealed that A20 and AN1 type zinc_finger domains of OsiSAP8 interact with each other.
 Overexpression of the gene in both transgenic tobacco and rice conferred tolerance to salt, drought and cold stress at seed germination/seedling stage as reflected by percentage of germination and gain in fresh weight after stress recovery.
Expression of the OsABI5 gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and high salinity, and down_regulated by drought and cold (4C) in seedlings.
 The OsABI5 protein was localized in the nucleus and has trans_activation activity.
 OsABI5 could bind to a G_box element and transactivate reporter gene expression.
 Complementation analysis revealed that the expression of OsABI5 driven by the 35S promoter could rescue ABA_insensitivity of abi5_1 during seed germination and result in hypersensitivity to ABA.
 Over_expression of OsABI5 in rice conferred high sensitivity to salt stress.
 Repression of OsABI5 promoted stress tolerance and resulted in low fertility of rice.
 These results suggested that OsABI5 could regulate the adaptive stress response and plant fertility of rice as a transcription factor.
 NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) is a plant specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in development and stress regulation.
 In this report, a stress_responsive NAC gene (SNAC2) isolated from upland rice IRA109 (Oryza sativa L.
 SNAC2 was proven to have transactivation and DNA_binding activities in yeast and the SNAC2_GFP fusion protein was localized in the rice nuclei.
 Northern blot and SNAC2 promoter activity analyses suggest that SNAC2 gene was induced by drought, salinity, cold, wounding, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
 The SNAC2 gene was over_expressed in japonica rice Zhonghua 11 to test the effect on improving stress tolerance.
 Over_expression of SNAC2 can also improve the tolerance to PEG treatment.
 Interestingly, none of the up_regulated genes in the SNAC2_overexpressing plants matched the genes up_regulated in the transgenic plants over_expressing other stress responsive NAC genes reported previously.
 These data suggest SNAC2 is a novel stress responsive NAC transcription factor that possesses potential utility in improving stress tolerance of rice.
 Expression analysis revealed that OsDREB1F gene was induced by salt, drought, cold stresses, and also ABA application, but not by pathogen, wound, and H2O2.
 Subcellular localization results indicated that OsDREB1F localizes in nucleus.
 Yeast activity assay demonstrated that OsDREB1F gene encodes a transcription activator, and can specifically bind to DRE/CRT but not to ABRE element.
 Transgenic plants harbouring OsDREB1F gene led to enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and low temperature in both rice and Arabidopsis.
 The further characterisation of OsDREB1F_overexpressing Arabidopsis showed that, besides activating the expression of COR genes which contain DRE/CRT element in their upstream promoter regions, the expression of rd29B and RAB18 genes were also activated, suggested that OsDREB1F may also participate in ABA_dependent pathway.
 We cloned the RL9 gene by way of a map_based cloning strategy.
 Molecular studies have revealed that RL9 encodes a GARP protein, an orthologue of Arabidopsis KANADIs.
 RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers.
 The transient expression of a RL9–GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor.
The aim of this work was to characterize the phot1 mutant of rice during early seedling growth in various light conditions.
 When phot1a mutants were grown under WL (100) and BL (40 lmol m_2 s_1), they demonstrated a considerable reduction in photosynthetic capacity, which included decreased leaf CO2 uptake and plant growth.
Culm mechanical strength is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding.
 To understand the molecular mechanisms that control culm mechanical strength, we identified a flexible culm1 (fc1) mutant by screening a rice T_DNA insertion mutant library.
 This mutant exhibited an abnormal development phenotype, including late heading time, semi_dwarf habit, and flexible culm.
 FC1 encodes a cinnamyl_alcohol dehydrogenase and is mainly expressed in the sclerenchyma cells of the secondary cell wall and vascular bundle region.
 In these types of cells, a deficiency of FC1 in the fc1 mutant caused a reduction in cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in lignin.
 Extracts from the first internodes and panicles of the fc1 plants exhibited drastically reduced cinnamyl_alcohol dehydrogenase activity.
 Further histological and biochemical analyses revealed that the p_hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl monomers in fc1 cell wall were reduced greatly.
 Our results indicated that FC1 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of lignin and the control of culm strength in rice.
 Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration.
 Interestingly, the OsMT1a expression was also induced specifically by Zn2treatment.
 Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn2.
 than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought.
_induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn2.
 The results indicated that OsIAA1 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated.
 Over_expression of OsIAA1 in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24_epiBL treatment.
 In addition, the OsIAA1_overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture.
 Protein interaction analysis suggested that OsIAA1 may act through interaction with OsARF1.
 T_DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of OsIAA1_overexpression plants.
 These data suggested that OsIAA1 may play important roles in the cross_talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis.
 Sequence analysis revealed 11 homologous genes of GL1 in rice, designated OsGL1_1 to OsGL1_11.
 Compared to the over_expression and wild type plants, the osgl1_2 mutant was more sensitive to drought stress at reproductive stage, suggesting an important role of this gene in drought resistance.
Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait that affects grain yield.
 We characterized a tillering dwarf mutant d88 derived from Oryza sativa ssp.
 A reduction in number and size of parenchyma cells around stem marrow cavity as well as a delay in the elongation of parenchyma cells caused slender tillers and dwarfism in the d88 mutant.
 The D88 gene was isolated via map_based cloning and identified to encode a putative esterase.
 The potential relationship between the tiller formation associated genes and D88 is discussed and future identification of the substrate for D88 may lead to the characterization of new pathways regulating plant developme.
COBRA_like proteins play important roles in cell expansion and cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
 In rice, a COBRA_like gene, BRITTLE CULM1 (BC1), has been identified as a regulator controlling the culm mechanical strength.
 Here we report a novel flower_specific PRP designated OsPRP3 from rice.
 Expression analysis showed that the OsPRP3 transcript was mainly present in rice flower and accumulated abundantly during the late stage of the flower development.
 To study the function of OsPRP3, we constructed and transformed a binary vector containing a full clone of OsPRP3 in sense orientation and also an RNAi vector to achieve overexpression and knockout of the gene, respectively.
 Our overexpression plants showed a significant increase in cold tolerance than the WT plants which is conferred by the accumulation of OsPRP3 protein during cold treatment.
 Further the microscopic analysis revealed that OsPRP3 enhances the cell wall integrity in the cold tolerant plant and confers cold_tolerance in rice.
 Microscopic analysis of the RNAi mutant flower revealed that blocking OsPRP3 function caused significant defects in floral organogenesis.
 Taken together, the results suggested that OsPRP3 is a cell wall protein, playing a crucial role in determining extracellular matrix structure of floral organs.
 In our current study in rice, we have newly isolated and characterized the OsABF1 (Oryza sativa ABA responsive element binding factor 1) gene that encodes a bZIP transcription factor.
 Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using GFP fusion vectors indicated that OsABF1 is a nuclear protein.
 In a yeast experiment, OsABF1 was shown to bind to ABA responsive elements (ABREs) and its N_terminal region was necessary to transactivate the downstream reporter gene.
 Furthermore, the upregulated expression of some ABA/ stress_regulated genes in response to ABA treatment was suppressed in these Osabf1 mutants.
 Our current results thus suggest that OsABF1 is involved in abiotic stress responses and ABA signaling in rice.
Leaf morphology is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding.
 We isolated three allelic mutants of NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 1 (nrl1) which showed phenotypes of reduced leaf width and semi_rolled leaves and different degrees of dwarfism.
 The NRL1 gene was mapped to the chromosome 12 and encodes the cellulose synthase_like protein D4 (OsCslD4).
 We conclude that OsCslD4 encoded by NRL1 plays a critical role in leaf morphogenesis and vegetative development in rice.
 To understand its transport in rice, we characterized OsZIP5, which is inducible under Zn deficiency.
 OsZIP5 complemented the growth defect of a yeast Zn_uptake mutant, indicating that OsZIP5 is a Zn transporter.
 Overexpression of the gene decreased the Zn concentration in shoots, but caused it to rise in the roots.
 However, they were tolerant to excess Zn and contained less Zn.
 These results indicate that OsZIP5 plays a role in Zn distribution within rice.
 Stomatal cells and pavement cells are smaller in the mutant, suggesting that WDL1 affects epidermal cell differentiation.
 The WDL1–sGFP signal coincided with the RFP signal driven by AtBIP–mRFP, indicating that WDL1 is an ER protein.
 We propose that WDL1 is involved in cutin organization, affecting depolymerizable components.
Seed germination is an important character for plant growth and seed quality.
 There, T_DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation.
 Overexpression of the gene enhanced seed germination.
 OsDSG1 is most similar to Arabidopsis AIP2, an E3 ligase targeting ABI3.
Yeast two_hybrid experiments showed that our OsDSG1 binds to OsABI3, indicating that OsDSG1 is a rice ortholog of AIP2.
 Selfubiquitination assay indicated that bacterially expressed OsDSG1 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
 Real_time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds.
 In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased.
 These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds.
 Finally, we observed that the germination rates of various rice cultivars depended upon the transcript levels of OsDSG1 and other ABA_signaling genes.
 Here, we report the characterization of OsNPR1, an Oryzae sativa (rice) ortholog of NPR1, focusing on its role in blast disease resistance and identification of OsNPR1_regulated genes.
 Blast resistance tests using OsNPR1 knockdown and overexpressing rice lines demonstrated the essential role of OsNPR1 in benzothiadiazole (BTH)_induced blast resistance.
 Genome_wide transcript profiling using OsNPR1_ knockdown lines revealed that 358 genes out of 1,228 BTH_upregulated genes and 724 genes out of 1,069 BTH_downregulated genes were OsNPR1_dependent with respect to BTH responsiveness, thereby indicating that OsNPR1 plays a more vital role in gene downregulation.
 Reduction of photosynthetic activity after BTH treatment and its negation by OsNPR1 knockdown were indeed reflected in the changes in Fv/Fm values in leaves.
 These results imply the role of OsNPR1 in the reallocation of energy and resources during defense responses.
In this article, we report an independent work of positional cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene in rice.
 OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase.
 Interestingly, OsJAG does not affect the number of floral organ primordial and so of floral organs in each whorl, suggesting that OsJAG does not influence the initiation of floral organ primordia, but affect the developmental fate of all floral organs after their primordia have initiated.
 Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil.
 The inhibition of seedling growth by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was greater in the OsCPK21_FOX plants than in WT plants.
 These results suggest that OsCPK21 is involved in the positive regulation of the signaling pathways that are involved in the response to ABA and salt stress.
Plant morphogenesis is highly dependent on the regulation of cell division and expansion.
 Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T_DNA insertion mutant library.
 It is reported here that OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA_like protein that exhibits typical structural features of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol_anchor protein.
 The T_DNA insertion in OsBC1L4 results in abnormal cell expansion.
 A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components.
 OsBC1L4 was expressed in all tissues/organs examined, with a low level in leaves.
 OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane.
 Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall_forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs).
 Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose_related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis.
 The OsCCC1 protein was located not only in onion plasma membrane but also in O.
 The OsCCC1 gene_silenced plants grow more slowly than wild_type (WT) plants, especially under the KCl treatment regime.
 In addition, seed germination, root length, and fresh and dry weight were distinctly lower in the genesilenced lines than in WT plants, especially after KCl treatment.
 contents, suggesting OsCCC1 may be involved in K.
 Results from different tests indicated that the OsCCC1 plays a significant role in K.
 Plants induce Fe acquisition systems under conditions of low Fe availability.
 Previously, we reported that an Fe_deficiency_inducible basic helix_loop_helix (bHLH) transcription factor, OsIRO2, is responsible for regulation of the genes involved in Fe homeostasis in rice.
 Using promoter_GUS transformants, we showed that OsIRO2 is expressed throughout a plant’s lifetime in a spatially and temporally similar manner to the genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and TOM1, which is involved in Fe absorption and translocation.
 During germination, OsIRO2 expression was detected in embryos.
 OsIRO2 expression in vegetative tissues was restricted almost exclusively to vascular bundles of roots and leaves, and to the root exodermis under Fe_sufficient conditions, and expanded to all tissues of roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency.
 OsIRO2 expression was also detected in flowers and developing seeds.
 Plants overexpressing OsIRO2 grew better, and OsIRO2_repressed plants showed poor growth compared to non_transformant rice after germination.
 OsIRO2 overexpression also resulted in improved tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soil.
 These results suggest that OsIRO2 is synchronously expressed with genes involved in Fe homeostasis, and performs a crucial function in regulation not only of Fe uptake from soil but also Fe transport during germination and Fe translocation to grain during seed maturation.
 Taking advantage of strategies in biochemistry, molecular cell biology and genetics, the RING_finger containing E3 ligase OsSDIR1 (Oryza sativa SALT_AND DROUGHT_INDUCED RING FINGER 1) was found to be a candidate drought tolerance gene for engineering of crop plants.
 The expression of OsSDIR1 was detected in all tissues of rice and up_regulated by drought and NaCl, but not by ABA.
 In vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrated that OsSDIR1 is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase and that the RING finger region is required for its activity.
 OsSDIR1 could complement the drought sensitive phenotype of the sdir1 mutant and overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis were more sensitive to ABA, indicating that the OsSDIR1 gene is a functional ortholog of SDIR1.
 Upon drought treatment, the OsSDIR1_transgenic rice showed strong drought tolerance compared to control plants.
In rice, the elongated internodes are derived from the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM), and the transition of the SAM from the vegetative to the reproductive stage induces internode elongation.
 During the seedling and tillering stages, sui1 plants are morphologically similar to wild_type plants.
 Microscopic analysis indicates that cell length of sui1_1 uppermost internode exhibits decreased.
 Map_based cloning revealed that SUI1 is located on Chromosome 1, and encodes a putative phosphatidyl serine synthase (PSS) family protein.
 Introduction of a wild_type SUI1 gene fully rescued the mutant phenotype of sui1_1 and sui1_2, confirming the identity of the cloned gene.
 Our results suggest that SUI1 plays an important role in regulating uppermost internode length by decreasing longitudinal cell length in rice.
 Under drought stress conditions, the mutant had significantly less accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugar and showed significantly reduced root volume, spikelet fertility, biomass, and grain yield; however, malondialdehyde level was increased in the mutant.
 Interestingly, overexpression of DSM3 (OsITPK2) in rice resulted in drought_ and salt_hypersensitive phenotypes and physiological changes similar to those in the mutant.
 The expression level of DSM3 promoter_driven b_glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in rice was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid.
 Protoplast transient expression assay indicated that DSM3 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein.
 Transcript level analysis of OsITPK genes revealed that they had different tempo_spatial expression patterns, and the responses of DSM3 to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, and high temperature, were distinct from the other five members in rice.
We report that phytochrome B (phyB) mutants exhibit improved drought tolerance compared to wild type (WT) rice (Oryza sativa L.
 To understand the underlying mechanism by which phyB regulates drought tolerance, we analyzed root growth and water loss from the leaves of phyB mutants.
 The root system showed no significant difference between the phyB mutants and WT, suggesting that improved drought tolerance has little relation to root growth.
 However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin_dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants.
 In addition, the developed leaves of phyB mutants displayed larger epidermal cells than WT leaves, resulting in reduced stomatal density.
 phyB deficiency promoted the expression of both putative ERECTA family genes and EXPANSIN family genes involved in cell expansion in leaves, thus causing greater epidermal cell expansion in the phyB mutants.
 Reduced stomatal density resulted in reduced transpiration per unit leaf area in the phyB mutants.
 Considering all these findings, we propose that phyB deficiency causes both reduced total leaf area and reduced transpiration per unit leaf area, which explains the reduced water loss and improved drought tolerance of phyB mutants.
 Using a map_based cloning strategy, the TH1 gene was narrowed down to a 60_kb region on the long arm of chromosome 2.
 The RNA_interference transgenic plants of LOC_Os02g56610 displayed a similar phenotype to the th1 mutant.
 Consequently, LOC_Os02g56610 was identified as the TH1 gene which encoded 248 amino acids and contained a DUF640 domain.
 RT_PCR analysis and GUS staining showed that the transcripts of TH1 mainly accumulated in young inflorescence, lemma and palea of spikelet.
 These results suggested that TH1 was an important gene controlling the lemma and palea development in rice.
Germination followed by seedling growth constitutes two essential steps in the initiation of a new life cycle in plants, and in cereals, completion of these steps is regulated by sugar starvation and the hormone gibberellin.
 The expression of OsCDPK1 was found to be specifically activated by sucrose starvation among several stress conditions tested as well as activated transiently during post_germination seedling growth.
 In gain_ and loss_of_function studies performed with transgenic rice overexpressing a constitutively active or RNA interference gene knockdown construct, respectively, OsCDPK1 was found to negatively regulate the expression of enzymes essential for GA biosynthesis.
 In contrast, OsCDPK1 activated the expression of a 14_3_3 protein, GF14c.
 Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings.
 Hence, our studies demonstrated that OsCDPK1 transduces the post_germination Ca2.
 Rice RNAi mutants silenced for SE5 were generated and displayed early flowering under long_day conditions, consistent with phenotypes of the null mutation in SE5 gene reported previously (se5 and s73).
 The herbicide methyl viologen (MV), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), was applied to determine whether SE5 regulates oxidative stress response.
 Compared with wild_type, SE5 RNAi transgenic plants aggravated seedling growth inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, and decreased the transcripts of some representative antioxidative genes.
 By contrast, administration of exogenous CO partially rescued corresponding MV hypersensitivity in the SE5 RNAi plants.
 Alleviation of seed germination inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, as well as the induction of antioxidant defense were further observed when SE5 or HY1 was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that SE5 may be useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to oxidative stress.
The TFIIIA_type zinc finger transcription factors are involved in plant development and abiotic stress responses.
 Overexpression of ZFP182 significantly enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerances, including salt, cold and drought tolerances in transgenic rice.
 Overexpression of ZFP182 promotes accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as free proline and soluble sugars, in transgenic rice.
 ZFP182 activates the expression of OsP5CS encoding pyrroline_5_carboxylate synthetase and OsLEA3 under stress conditions, while OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were regulated by ZFP182 under both normal and stress conditions.
 Interestingly, sitedirected mutagenesis assay showed that DRE_like elements in ZFP182 promoter are involved in dehydration_induced expression of ZFP182.
 The yeast two_hybrid assay revealed that ZFP182 interacted with several ribosomal proteins including ZIURP1, an ubiquitin fused to ribosomal protein L40.
 The in vivo and in vitro interactions of ZFP182 and ZIURP1 were further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and His pull_down assays.
 Here we show that the expression of Oshox22 is strongly induced by salt stress, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatment (PEG), and weakly by cold stress.
 Trans_activation assaysin yeast and transient expression analyses in rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox22 is able to bind the CAAT(G/C)ATTG element and acts as a transcriptional activator that requires both the HD and Zip domains.
 Rice plants homozygous for a T_DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox22 showed reduced Oshox22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage.
 In contrast, transgenic rice over_expressing Oshox22 showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA content, and decreased drought and salt tolerances.
 Based on these results, we conclude that Oshox22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA_mediated signal transduction pathways.
 Here, we characterized two rice pathogen_responsive NAC transcription factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131.
 ONAC122 and ONAC131 expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M.
 ONAC122 and ONAC131 were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1_aminocyclopropane_1_car_boxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene).
 Silencing ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression using a newly modified Brome mosaic virus (BMV)_based silencing vector resulted in an enhanced susceptibility to M.
 OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down_regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV_based silencing system.
 Our results suggest that both ONAC122 and ONAC131 have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense_ and signaling_related genes.
 The mutation arose from a single amino acid substitution of OsSNDP1 (Oryza sativa Sec14_nodulin domain protein), which shows high sequence homology with Arabidopsis COW1/AtSFH1 and encodes a phospha_tidylinositol transfer protein (PITP).
 By performing complementation assays with Atsfh1 mutants, we demonstrated that OsSNDP1 is involved in growth of root hairs.
 Cryoscanning electron microscopy was utilized to further characterize the effect of the Ossndp1 mutation on root hair morphology.
 Aberrant morphogenesis was detected in root hair elongation and maturation zones.
 Many epidermal cells also produced dome_shaped root hairs, which indicated that root hair elongation ceased at an early stage.
 These studies showed that PITP_mediated phospholipid signaling and metabolism is critical for root hair elongation in rice.
 The expression levels of the drought_responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up_regulated in the OsDIL_over_expression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down_regulated.
 Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down_regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought.
 Functional analysis showed that OsbZIP71 is a nuclear_localized protein that specifically binds to the G_box motif, but has no transcriptional activity both in yeast and rice protoplasts.
 In yeast two_hybrid assays, OsbZIP71 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with Group C members of the bZIP gene family.
 Expression of OsbZIP71 was strongly induced by drought, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and ABA treatments, but repressed by salt treatment.
 OsbZIP71 overexpressing (p35S.
 Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants.
 Changes in the leaf pigmentation of the mutant were due to altered chlorophyll  content and chloroplast development.
 The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast.
  WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves.
 In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the  low temperature.
 The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants.
 These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions.
 Homologous recombination occurred at the CEBiP locus in ~0.
 In the self_pollinated next generation, it was confirmed that the first exon of CEBiP was replaced with the hygromycin selection cassette as designed, and that the expression of CEBiP was completely deficient in homozygous cebip lines.
 Affinitylabeling analysis using biotinylated N_acetylchitooctaose demonstrated that CEBiP is the major CE_binding protein in rice cultured cells and leaves, which was consistent with the result that the response to CE in cebip cells was greatly diminished.
 Nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, only when  the cebip leaf sheaths were inoculated with a weakly virulent strain, suggesting that CE perception during the infection process of M.
 oryzae is limited.
 The response to peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides in cebip cells was not affected, strongly suggesting that CEBiP is a CE_specific receptor.
SIMILAR TO RCD ONE (SRO) is a plant_specific gene family involved in development and abiotic stress responses.
 However, the ossro1c_1 mutant and artificial microRNA_OsSRO1c transgenic rice were significantly impaired in cold tolerance.
 When compared with the well_characterized Arabidopsis SRO protein radical_induced cell death 1 (RCD1), OsSRO1c has considerable variation in the protein sequence, and the two genes exhibit different expression profiles under abiotic stresses.
 By screening an Arabidopsis transcription factor library, 29 transcription factors interacted with OsSRO1c in yeast, but only two of these transcription factors were reported to interact with RCD1, which may partly explain the different responses of the two mutants under various stresses.
 The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of OsSRO1c in mediating responses to multiple abiotic stress.
While Arabidopsis bears only one MET1 gene encoding the DNA methyltransferase that is mainly responsible for maintaining CG methylation after DNA replication, rice carries two MET1 genes, MET1a and MET1b, expressed in actively replicating and dividing  cells, and MET1b is more abundantly expressed than is MET1a.
 A met1a null mutant displayed no overt phenotypes, implying that MET1b must play a major role in the maintenance DNA methylation.
 Here, we employed two met1b null mutants, generated by homologous recombination_mediated knock_in targeting and insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17.
 They also displayed decreased levels of DNA methylation at repetitive CentO sequences and at the FIE1 gene locus in the embryos.
 In addition, independently isolated knock_in_targeted plants, in which the promoterless GUS reporter gene was fused with the endogenous MET1b promoter, showed the reproducible, dosage_dependent, and spatiotemporal expression patterns of GUS.
 The genotyping analysis of selfed progeny of heterozygous met1a met1b null mutants indicated that weakly active MET1a seems to serve as a genetic backup mechanism in rice met1b gametophytes, although the stochastic and uncoordinated activation of epigenetic backup mechanisms occurred less efficiently in the met1b homozygotes of rice than in the met1 homozygotes of Arabidopsis.
 Moreover, passive depletion of CG methylation during the postmeiotic DNA replication in the haploid nuclei of the met1a met1b gametophytes in rice results in early embryonic lethality.
 OsCAF1A and OsCAF1G mRNA were found to be abundant in the leaves of mature plants.
 Two types of OsCAF1B mRNA transcript were detected in an inverse expression pattern in various tissues.
 OsCAF1B was transient, induced by droug t, cold, abscisic acid, and wounding treatments.
 OsCAF1H mRNA was not detected either under normal conditions or during most stress treatments, but only accumulated during heat stress.
 OsCAF1B fluorescent fusion proteins were located in discrete cytoplasmic foci and fibers.
 We present evidences that OsCAF1B colocalizes with AtXRN4, a processing body marker, and AtKSS12, a microtubules maker, indicating that OsCAF1B is a component of the plant P_body and associate with microtubules.
 Furthermore, loss_of_function mutation of OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34 (At5g22920), an OsRZFP34 homolog in Arabidopsis, decreased relative stomata aperture under nonstress control conditions.
 Expressing OsRZFP34 in atrzfp34 reverted the mutant phenotype to normal, which indicates a conserved molecular function between OsRZFP34 and AtRZFP34.
 Thus, stomata opening, enhanced leaf cooling, and ABA insensitivity was conserved with OsRZFP34 expression.
 Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing OsRZFP34 revealed many genes involved in OsRZFP34_mediated stomatal movement.
 We suggest that OsRZFP34 may modulate these genes to control stomata opening.
 In rice, the transcription factor WRKY45 plays a central role in this process.
 To investigate the mechanism involved in defense_priming  by BTH and the role of WRKY45 in this process, we analyzed the transcripts of biosynthetic genes for diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs) during the rice–Magnaporthe oryzae interaction.

 The second sheath and shoot elongation responses of the dwarf mutant to exogenous gibberellin (GA3) showed that sdg was insensitive to gibberellin (GA), and its endogenous GAs content was higher than that in wild_type cultivars.
 The SDG gene was cloned by a map_based cloning method and sequencing analysis revealed that the coding region of sdg had a single nucleotide substitution resulting in a single amino acid change from alanine to threonine.
 The dwarf phenotype of the sdg mutant was restored to a normal phenotype by introducing the wild_type SDG gene.
 Rice transformation experiments and GUS staining demonstrated that the SDG gene was predominantly expressed in vegetative organs.
 A strong browning symptom was observed in the second internode (Int2, counted from the top) and part of panicles of ospk1 at the late productive phase.
 Furthermore, higher levels of H2O2 in flag leaf and Int2 were observed in ospk1 than those in wild type.
 These data suggest that ospk1 may undergo certain stress, especially oxidative stress.
 Here, we provide evidences that the downregulation of OsPK1 (a cytosolic pyruvate kinase) in ospk1 mutant results in variations in ABA/GA balance in rice and contributes to oxidative stress, which provide a new clue for understanding the connection of pyruvate kinase, ABA/GA balance, and oxidative stress in rice.
 Rice seedlings overexpressing OsMADS15 showed precocious phenotypes of early internode elongation, shoot_borne crown root development, reduced plant height and early flowering.
 The axillary buds developments in OsMADS15 overexpressors were accelerated, and the buds frequently grew into effective tillers.
 The panicles of OsMADS15 transgenic rice plants were largely compromised for growth and branching in comparison with wild type.
 In the tillering stage, the OsMADS15 overexpression rice plants tillered later and less than the wild type, and in the maturity stage, the culms of the overexpression lines bore more stem nodes.
 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL_related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations.
 These results clearly indicate that OsMADS15 plays important roles not only in transition to reproductive development, but also in crown root development.
 In bls1 mutant, floral_organ identity and floral_organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected.
 We isolated BLS1 by positional cloning and found that it encodes a protein with a conserved domain of unknown function.
 BLS1 is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets.
 Subcellular localization analysis showed that BLS1 is localized in the nucleus.
 Expression of the AP1_like and SEP_like floral homeotic genes were not changed in the bls1 mutant.
 Our study suggested that BLS1 is required for lateral development of the lemma and palea and does not function at stages of floral_organ initiation and patterning.
 Here, we cloned a rice xylanase_inhibiting protein (XIP)_type gene OsHI_XIP whose encoding protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
 Moreover, overexpression of OsHI_XIP decreased the feeding and oviposion preferences of the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, but did not influence the growth and development of rice plants.
The results suggest that the rice XIP_type xylanase inhibitor OsHI_XIP is involved in the resistance in rice to herbivores.
To improve our understanding of the molecular–genetic mechanisms governing leaf and root development in rice (Oryza sativa), we investigated narrow leaf1 (nal1), a pleiotropic mutant with short and narrow leaves, semi_dwarf stature, and fewer adventitious (or crown) roots.
 The narrow leaf5 (nal5) and nal1 mutants display similar defects in leaf and root development.
 NAL1 encodes a putative trypsin_like serine/cysteine protease; the coding region of nal5 contains a missense mutation and nal1 harbors a 30_bp deletion.
 Quantitative real_time PCR revealed that nal1 mutants have altered expression levels of many OSHB, YABBY, and PIN_FORMED genes associated with leaf development and auxin transport.
 In addition, expression levels of CROWN ROOTLESS genes are markedly down_regulated in nal1.
 These results indicate that NAL1 functions in the regulation of both leaf and adventitious root development at the transcriptional level.
 Based on our results, we propose that NAL1 plays important roles in adventitious root development in rice.
 Overexpression of OsWR2 in rice increased the total cuticular wax level by 48.
 Our results showed that 19 genes previously associated with wax and cutin biosynthesis were up_regulated in OsWR2 overexpressors.
 Overexpression of OsWR2 also altered cuticular wax crystallization and cuticle membrane ultrastructure.
 Furthermore, OsWR2 overexpression in rice decreased leaf chlorophyll leaching rate, reduced water loss rate, and enhanced tolerance to water_limited conditions.
 We demonstrate in this report that OsWR2 regulates wax and cutin biosynthesis differently than does the OsWR1 homologue, and plays a major role in controlling cuticle permeability.
 The increased resistance to water deficit conditions by OsWR2 overexpression in rice elucidates a potential new strategy for genetic improvement of plant drought tolerance.
 However, the intracellular GB level and the tolerance to salt stress of the transgenic lines overexpressing OsCMO were significantly enhanced.
 Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that abundant functional OsCMO proteins with correct size were detected in OsCMO_overexpressing transgenic rice plants, but rarely accumulated in the wild type.
 Instead, the defective expression of OsCMO resulted in non_GB accumulation.
Flowering transition and floral organ development influence plant propagation and crop yield.
 Polycomb_group (PcG) gene EMF2 restrains flowering by suppressing floral organ identity genes as an epigenetic regulator in Arabidopsis.
 Here, we identified that OsEMF2b, a homologue of EMF2, acted as a regulator of flowering transition and floral organ identity in rice.
 The OsEMF2b T_DNA insertion mutations and RNA interference transgenic plants cause late flowering, whereas OsEMF2b overexpressing lines result in early flowering.
 The transcript levels of genes involved in rice flowering pathway differ in wild_type plants and osemf2b mutants.
 The transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 decrease, whereas the expression level of OsLFL1 increases in the osemf2b mutants under short_day and long_day conditions.
 These results indicated that OsEMF2b functioned as the upregulator of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 and the downregulator of OsLFL1 during floral induction.
 Quantitative RT_PCR assay indicated that OsEMF2b regulated the transcript levels o floral homeotic A_, B_, C_, D_, and E_class genes and participated in floral organ development in rice.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsEMF2b was directly associated with OsLFL1 and OsMADS4, such that the H3K27me3 was enriched on these target genes chromatin in WT but not in the OsEMF2b RNAi plants.
 Our results demonstrate that OsEMF2b promotes flowering through direct suppressing of the OsLFL1 expression (a suppressor of flowering) via a mechanism distinct from Arabidopsis.
 Transient expression of GFP_Os_GAPC3 fusion protein in onion epidermal cells revealed that OsGAPC3 was indeed a cytosolic protein.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsGAPC3 showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress.
 Furthermore, we found that OsGAPC3 could alleviate the salt toxicity through the regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels.
 Taken together, these results indicate that OsGAPC3 plays important roles in salt stress tolerance in rice.
 Our data suggested that the increased tolerance to these abiotic stresses in transgenic plants might be due to up_regulation of some stress_dependent/independent genes and OSRIP18 may be potentially useful in further improving plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses by over_expression.
 The OsMRP5 gene, of which mutations are known to reduce seed PA as well as seed yield and viability, was down_regulated specifically in rice seeds by using an artificial microRNA driven by the rice seed specific promoter Ole18.
 No consistent significant differences of plant height or number of tillers per plant were observed, but significantly lower seed weights (up to 17.
8 % reduction) were detected in all transgenic lines compared to null plants, accompanied by reductions of seed germination and seedling emergence.
 It was observed that the silencing of the OsMRP5 gene increased the inorganic P (Pi) levels (up to 7.
 This indicates a reduction in P content in other cellular compounds, such as lipids and nucleic acids, which may affect overall seed development.
 Put together, the present study demonstrated that seed specific silencing of OsMRP5 could significantly reduce the PA content and increase Pi levels in seeds; however, it also significantly lowers seed weight in rice.
 Some members of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family function in degradation of storage lipids during the seed germination, but little is known about their influence on seed longevity during storage.
 We characterized the role of rice OsLOX2 gene in seed germination and longevity via over_expression and knock_down approaches.
 Lines over_expressing OsLOX2 showed accelerated seed germination under normal condition and lower seed viability after accelerated aging.
 RNA interference (RNAi) of OsLOX2 caused delayed germination and enhanced seed longevity.
 Therefore, OsLOX2 acts in opposite directions during seed germination and longevity during storage.
The class III homeodomain_leucine zipper (HD_Zip III) gene family plays important roles in plant growth and development, including regulation of apical embryo patterning, embryonic shoot meristem formation, leaf polarity, vascular development, and meristem function, with a particularly crucial function in leaf development.
 In this study, we analyzed a HD_Zip III member, OsHox33, and demonstrated that it plays an important role in age_dependent leaf senescence in rice.
 We constructed two specific RNAi vectors derived from the 5′_end region and 3′_UTR of OsHox33 to knockdown its expression.
 Transgenic plants harboring either RNAi construct displayed similar phenotypes of precocious leaf senescence symptoms, suggesting that knockdown of OsHox33 accelerates leaf senescence in rice.
Moderate leaf rolling is one of the most important morphological traits in rice breeding for plant ideotype.
 Previous studies have shown that the rl(t) gene has a high breeding potential for developing hybrid_rice varieties with an ideal ideotype, because it leads to an appropriate leaf rolling index (LRI) of about 30 % in the heterozygous state, and had a positive effect on grain yield.
 In this study, we isolated rl(t) and performed a preliminary investigation of its function in regulating leaf rolling in rice.
 DNA sequencing identified a single base change (G to T) in the finely mapped region (11 kb) containing rl(t), and this is located in 30_untranslated region (30_UTR) of the only predicted gene, Roc5 (Rice outermost cell_specific).
 The expression level of Roc5 is significantly higher in the rl(t) mutant than in the wild_type.
 Using RNAi and over_expression analysis, we found that the expression level of Roc5 correlated with LRI and leaf bulliform area, and was also associated with leaf abaxial or adaxial rolling.
 These results confirmed that Roc5 controls leaf rolling in a dosage_dependent manner.
 Based on the model of this element in regulating mRNA stability in mammals, we speculate that the single nucleotide change in this element accounts for the higher expression level of Roc5 in the rl(t) mutant compared to the wild_type, which ultimately leads to adaxial rolling of the leaf.
 This discovery further enhances our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf rolling in rice.
 A number of genes related to panicle development have been cloned and functionally characterized so far.
 However, more information is needed for fully understanding of the mechanism underlying the panicle development.
 Moreover, cl4 mutant also shows shorter plant height than that of the wild type.
 As a result, CL4 is demonstrated to encode a putative cytochrome P450 protein CYP724B1, which is involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis.
 These results provide strong evidence that CL4 plays an important role in rice panicle development as well as plant height regulat o .
 The evaluation of yield and carbon (C) and N content of osaat knockout mutants also suggested the important roles of the OsAAT5, OsAAT7, OsAAT24, OsAAT49 and OsAAT60 genes in yield and biomass production and C and N metabolism and distribution in rice plants.
 We tested the expression of 57 NAC genes in the presence of NaCl in young leaves of two elite rice cultivars, Cotaxtla and Tres Rı´os, which display contrasting responses to salinity at the biochemical and physiological levels.
 Using qRT_PCR, the expression of 41 out of 57 NAC genes was validated, of which 23 showed regulation by NaCl.
 We identified two NAC genes (Os02g56600 and Os12g07790) induced in Cotaxtla, but repressed in Tres Rı´os when plants were exposed to 100 mM NaCl in nutrient solution.
 Furthermore, shoot growth was more affected in both cultivars, while root length was not reduced in treated plants in comparison to the controls.
 We conclude that both elite rice cultivars exhibit different expression patterns of NAC transcription factors as well as biochemical and physiological responses to salt stress, giving rise to better performance of Cotaxtla plants in comparison to Tres Rı´os plants under our experimental conditions.
 Six deletion constructs were made to delineate the binding domain of the UIP1 protein.
 Further deletion at the region between 52 and 212 amino acids revealed that the CBS domain of UIP1 is necessary for binding to 30 RbcS.
 Transgenic overexpression of UIP1 in rice resulted in an increase in tolerance to drought stress at the vegetative stage of growth.
 Under drought, high salt and low temperature conditions, the maximum photo_chemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) of UIP1 plants was higher than those of the nontransgenic plants.
 Interestingly, the effect of UIP1 overexpression on tolerance to stress was much more pronounced under drought than under high salt and low temperature conditions.
 Taken together, our results demonstrate that UIP1 interacts with 30 untranslated region of RbcS1 mRNA and increases tolerance of transgenic overexpressors to drought stress.
 In phylogenetic analysis, OsMAPK33 (Os02g0148100) showed approximately 47–93% identity at the amino acid level with other plant MAPKs.
 To investigate the biological functions of OsMAPK33 in rice MAPK signalling, transgenic rice plants that either overexpressed or suppressed OsMAPK33 were made.
 Under dehydration conditions, the suppressed lines showed lower osmotic potential compared with that of wild_type plants, suggesting a role of OsMAPK33 in osmotic homeostasis.
 Nonetheless, the suppressed lines did not display any significant difference in drought tolerance compared with their wild_type plants.
 However, the overexpressing lines showed greater reduction in biomass accumulation and higher sodium uptake into cells, resulting in a lower K+ /Na+ ratio inside the cell than that in the wild_type plants and OsMAPK33_suppressed lines.
 These results suggest that OsMAPK33 could play a negative role in salt tolerance through unfavourable ion homeostasis.
 Gene expression profiling of OsMAPK33 transgenic lines through rice DNA chip analysis showed that OsMAPK33 altered expression of genes involved in ion transport.
 The promoter of AtSAG12 is SA_responsive and reported to be useful to delay senescence by expressing cytokinin biosynthesis gene isopentenyltransferase specifically during senescence in several plants including Arabidopsis, lettuce and rice.
 OsSAG12_1 is the closest homologue of AtSAG12 with 64% similar amino acid composition.
 Expression of OsSAG12_1 is induced during senescence and pathogen_induced cell death.
 To evaluate the possible role of OsSAG12_1 we generated RNAi transgenic lines in Japonica rice cultivar TP309.
 The transgenic lines developed early senescence at varying levels and showed enhanced cell death when inoculated with bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
oryzae.
 Our results suggest that OsSAG12_1 is a negative regulator of cell death in rice.
 Our previous studies indicate that OsWRKY62, an OsWRKY IIa subfamily member, functions as a negative regulator of the rice defense against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae.
 A twenty_four and a seven_ fold higher level of OsCam1_1 transcripts were detected in the leaves of the FL530_IL and KDML105 rice cultivars, respectively, after 30 min of salt stress compared to non_salt_stressed plants.
 Transgenic rice lines that constitutively over_express the OsCam1_1 gene were found to up_regulate ABA aldehyde oxidase and 9_cis_epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3, two genes involved in ABA biosynthesis, and to have a higher ABA content, when compared to the wild type and the control transgenic lines without OsCam1_1 over_expression.
 In addition, transgenic plants over_expressing OsCam1_1 were more tolerant to salt stress, with, for example, a better ability to maintain their shoot and root mass (as dry weight) during salt stress, than the control plants.
 These data indicate that OsCam1_1 signaling is likely to play an important role in ABA biosynthesis, and the level of OsCam1_1 gene expression and ABA accumulation probably contribute to salt resistance in rice.
 Here, we investigated its functioning in pollen development.
 Overexpression of OsPCBP in transgenic rice plants did not lead to phenotypic changes but did delay anther formation by about 1 week.
 Cytological observations at different stages revealed that microspores from the OsPCBP double_stranded RNA interference plants developed normally until the binucleate stage, but about half were later aborted.
 Further examination of OsPCBP expression in transgenic lines via RT_PCR showed that a significant reduction in transcripts was correlated with this abortion phenotype.
 Our experimental results provide convincing evidence that OsPCBP protein plays an important role during the late stage of pollen development.
 Tillering is an essential factor used to determine the overall architecture of cereal crops.
 To better understand the relationship between auxin levels and tillering in rice, we examined rice plants with increased or decreased levels of free IAA.
 The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over_expressing this gene.
 The number of tillers and panicles significantly increased in the transgenic lines compared to the wild_type plants, while plant height and panicle length decreased.
 Exogenous IAA treatment at concentrations of 10 µM and 100 µM significantly reduced tiller number in three different rice cultivars.
 Here we reported the identification,molecular and functional characterization of the gene encoding rice (Oryza sativa L, seed LOX3 (sLOX3).
 We next showed that overexpression of sLOX3 in a japonica sLOX3_normal rice cultivar, Wuyunjing 7 accelerated the decrease of seed germination ability when the seeds were routinely stored, which demonstrated that sLOX3 had a negative effect on seed longevity (storability).
 Meanwhile,an increased occurrence of embryo decay was observed in the same transgenic seeds, suggesting that sLOX3 might negatively affect seed longevity by facilitating colonization of particular seed pathogens.
 Our result forwarded the understanding of the effects of 9_LOX on rice seed longevity.
Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsDREB6 was induced in response to dehydration, high salinity, and most importantly by cold stress (4°C).
 Analysis using the yeast one_hybrid system showed that OsDREB6 had transcriptional activation activity and bound specifically to the DRE ciselement.
 Overexpression of OsDREB6 increased tolerance to osmotic, high salt, and cold stresses in transgenic rice whereas,OsDREB6 double_stranded RNA interference (RNAi) lines were found to be more sensitive to these stresses than wildtype rice.
 Additionally, sugar, proline and catalase levels in OsDREB6 RNAi lines were significantly lower than in the corresponding OsDREB6 overexpression lines and control lines after PEG treatment.
 The data suggests that OsDREB6 may participate in the stress response by mediating the expression of specific genes, and may also be involved plant metabolism.
Together, these results indicated that OsDREB6 plays an important role in the response of plants to a wide range of osmotic stresses.
The tapetum of the anther locule encloses the male reproductive cells and plays a supportive role for normal pollen development.
 Chemical analysis uncovered that pda1 anther had significant lower levels of cutin monomers and cuticular waxes.
 PDA1 gene encodes an ATP_binding cassette (ABC) half_transporter,namely OsABCG15, which is conserved from algae to higher plants.
 In situ RNA hybridization assay showed that PDA1 is strongly expressed in tapetal cells, and weakly in microspores during the anther development.
 Additionally,the expression of two pollen exine biosynthetic genes CYP704B2 and CYP703A3 was dramatically reduced in pda1 mutant anthers.
 Altogether, these observations suggest that the tapetum_expressed ABC transporter PDA1 plays a crucial role in secreting lipidic precursors from the tapetum to developing microspores and the anther epidermis.
 Chlorophyll contents of bgl11 decreased significantly than that of its wild_type parent.
 To isolate the BGL11(t) gene, a map_based cloning strategy was employed, and the gene was finally mapped in a 94.
 Accordingly, the gene (LOC_Os11g38040) was identified as the BGL11(t) gene.
These results are very valuable for further study on BGL11(t) gene and illuminating the mechanism of chloroplast development in rice.
Compared to the wild type, the panicle of dp2 mutant exhibited more branches and denser grains.
 Further more, the number of spikelets per panicle, number of primary branches and secondary branches of dp2 mutant were significantly increased while the panicle length, and 1,000_grain weight were significantly decreased.
 Polymorphic analysis of SSR and InDel markers demonstrated that the DP2 gene was located at the long arm of chromosome 2,which was further mapped between SSR markers RM341 and RM13356 in a physical region of 398 kb.
 Within this region, the RCN2 (LOC_Os02g32950) gene which was annotated relating to the development of rice panicle was found.
 Compared to the wild type, the sequence of RCN2 gene in the dp2 mutant showed that two SNPs replacement had taken place in the promoter region (G–A) and the intron region (A–T), respectively.
 The dp2 mutant could be a novel mutant of RCN2 gene and this novel mutant might be useful for further studies on this gene.
 ZFP182 codes an 18.
 The expression analysis showed that ZFP182 gene was constitutively expressed in leaves, culms, roots and spikes at the adult rice plants, and markedly induced in the seedlings by cold (4 °C), 150 mM NaCl and 0.
4 kb promoter region of ZFP182 gene was fused into GUS reporter gene and transformed into tobacco.
 Expression of ZFP182 in transgenic tobacco and overexpression in rice increased plant tolerance to salt stress.
 These results demonstrated that ZFP182 might be involved in plant responses to salt stress.
 OsWRKY53 was also induced in suspension_cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.
 A fusion of OsWRKY53 with green fluorescent protein was detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and OsWRKY53 protein specifically bound to W_box elements.
 A transient assay using the particle bombardment method showed that OsWRKY53 is a transcriptional activator.
 Finally, overexpression of OsWRKY53 in rice plants resulted in enhanced resistance to M.
 These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY53 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor_induced defense signaling pathways in rice.
Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)+ RNA from suspension_cultured rice cells treated with jasmonic acid (JA) for 1/2 h yielded a cDNA of a gene tentatively named RERJ1 that is upregulated in response to exogenous JA.
 Northern blot analysis indicated that the RERJ1 mRNA levels peaked at 1/2–1 h after the addition of jasmonic acid and then decreased gradually.
 RERJ1 encodes a transcriptional regulator with a basic helix–loop–helix motif.
 The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing sense or antisense RERJ1 mRNA demonstrated that RERJ1 is involved in the growth inhibition of rice shoots caused by JA.
 Other biological functions of RERJ1 are discussed from an evolutionary standpoint.
The plant_specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) transcription factors play diverse roles in plant development and stress responses.
 In this study, a rice NAC gene, ONAC045, was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in abiotic stress resistance.
 Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots.
 Transcriptional activation assay in yeast indicated that ONAC045 functioned as a transcriptional activator.
 Transient expression of GFP_ONAC045 in onion epidermal cells revealed that ONAC045 protein was localized in the nucleus.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments.
 Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress_responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice.
 Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA_binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold.
However, the transcript levels of two rice OsDEG10 homologs were not changed under those treatments.
 Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses.
 Specifically, down_regulation of HDA703 by amiRNA reduced rice peduncle elongation and fertility, while inactivation of a closely related homolog HDA710 by RNAi affected vegetative growth.
 HDA704 RNAi altered plant height and flag leaf morphology.
 Down_regulation of HDT702 led to the production of narrowed leaves and stems.
 Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues.
 The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26 nt siRNA_mediated gene silencing, displayed semi_dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant.
 Structural homology modeling predicted a superoxide dismutase (SOD) domain in OsGLP1 protein which upon over_expression in transgenic tobacco plant clearly documented SOD activity.
 Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension,cell wall_associated localization particularly in the sub_epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of OsGLP1 could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant.
 MTR1 is specifically expressed in the male reproductive cells, yet its mutant exhibits defects in both tapetum and microspore development, causing complete male sterility.
 We also demonstrate that the fasciclin domains, N_glycolation, and N_terminal signal peptide_mediated plasma membrane localization of MTR1 are required for normal anther development and pollen fertility.
 Our findings show that rice male reproductive cells secrete the MTR1 protein to control the development of reproductive cells and their adjacent somatic cells,thus providing novel insights into the mechanism of plant male reproductive development.
 Extensive analyses have elucidated the components of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling, but the physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of auxin degradation remain elusive.
Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2_oxoglutarate_dependent_Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice.
 Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries.
 Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants.
We show that recombinant DAO converts the active IAA into biologically inactive 2_oxoindole_3_acetic acid (OxIAA) in vitro.
 Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development.
We previously identified a salt and drought stressresponsive TFIIIA_type zinc finger protein gene ZFP252 from rice.
 Here we report the functional analysis of ZFP252 using gain_ and loss_of_function strategies.
 We found that overexpression of ZFP252 in rice increased the amount of free proline and soluble sugars, elevated the expression of stress defense genes and enhanced rice tolerance to salt and drought stresses, as compared with ZFP252 antisense and non_transgenic plants.
 Our findings suggest that ZFP252 plays an important role in rice response to salt and drought stresses and is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses.
 Over_expression of mtHsp70 suppressed heat_ and H2O2_induced programmed cell death (PCD) in rice protoplasts, as reflected by higher cell viability, decreased DNA laddering and chromatin condensation.
 Mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) after heat shock was destroyed gradually in protoplasts, but mtHsp70 over_expression showed higher Dwm relative to the vector control cells, and partially inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol.
 Together, these results suggest that mtHsp70 may suppress PCD in rice protoplasts by maintaining mitochondrial Dwm and inhibiting the amplification of ROS.
Leaf senescence is a complex and highly organized process resulting in numerous changes of gene expression and metabolic procedures.
 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the plant Abc1 proteins could be divided into three subgroups and OsAbc1_2 resides in a subgroup with potential chloroplast origin.
 The expression of OsSYP71 was clearly up_regulated under these stresses.
Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild_type plants.
 These results indicate that Qc_SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast.
Lesion mimic is necrotic lesions on plant leaf or stem in the absence of pathogenic infection, and its exact biological mechanism is varied.
 Map_based cloning revealed that RLIN1 encoded a putative coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway.
 Sequencing results showed that a G to T substitution occurred in the second exon of RLIN1 and led to a missense mutation from Asp to Tyr.
 Ectopic expression of RLIN1 could rescue rlin1 lesion mimic phenotype.
 Histochemical analysis demonstrated that lesion formation in rlin1 was light_dependent accompanied by reactive oxygen species accumulated.
Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases.
 Using map_based strategy and in silico approach we isolated a new rice (Oryza sativa L, blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated Pi25, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2.
 Overexpression analysis and complementation test showed that Pi25 conferred blast resistance to M.
 oryzae isolate js001_20.
 Sequence analysis showed that Pi25 was an intronless gene of 2772 nucleotides with single nucleotide substitution in comparison to Pid3 at the nucleotide position 459 and predicatively encoded a typical coiled coilenucleotide binding siteeleucine rich repeat (CCeNBSeLRR) protein of 924 amino acid residuals with 100% identity to Pid3 putative protein.
 The susceptible allele pi25 in Nipponbare contained a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2209 resulting in a truncated protein with 736 amino acid residuals.
 In addition, 14 nucleotide substitutions resulting in 10 amino acid substitutions were identified between Pi25 and pi25 upstream the premature stop codon in the susceptible allele.
 Although the mechanism of Pi25/Pid3_mediated resistance needs to be further investigated, the isolation of the allele would facilitate the utilization of Pi25/Pid3 in rice blast resistance breeding program via transgenic approach and marker assisted selection.
 One of them,OsWRKY71, was up_regulated by several defense signaling molecules, such as SA,methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 1_aminocyclo_propane_1_carboxylic acid (ACC), as well as wounding and pathogen infection, suggesting that OsWRKY71 might function in rice biotic stress response.
Flowering time is regulated by genetic programs and environment signals in plants.
 Genetic analysis of flowering time mutants is instrumental in dissecting the regulatory pathways of flower induction.
 The flowering_promoting gene Ehd1 and its downstream genes are all down_regulated in W378.
 In our current study, we have isolated and characterized a group A bZIP transcription factor in rice, OsABF2 (Oryza sativa ABA_responsive element binding factor 2).
 Subcellular localization analysis in maize protoplasts using a GFP fusion vector indicated that OsABF2 is a nuclear protein.
 In yeast experiments, OsABF2 was shown to bind to ABA_responsive elements (ABREs) and its N_terminal region found to be necessary to transactivate a downstream reporter gene.
 A homozygous T_DNA insertional mutant of OsABF2 is more sensitive to salinity, drought, and oxidative stress compared with wild type plants.
 In addition, this Osabf2 mutant showed a significantly decreased sensitivity to high levels of ABA at germination and post_germination.
 Collectively, our present results indicate that OsABF2 functions as a transcriptional regulator that modulates the expression of abiotic stress_responsive genes through an ABA_dependent pathway.
 OsDOG was induced by gibberellic acid (GA3) and repressed by the GA_synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol.
 Different transgenic lines with constitutive expression of OsDOG showed dwarf phenotypes due to deficiency of cell elongation.
 OsDOG has a novel function in regulating GA homeostasis and in negative maintenance of plant cell elongation in rice.
6] catalyzes to produce SAM (S_adenosyl_lmethionine), a universal methyl group donor in biochemical reactions in cells.
 Here, we demonstrate that OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 are essential for histone H3K4me3 and DNA methylation to regulate gene expression related to flowering in Oryza sativa.
RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice with downregulated transcripts of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfism, reduced fertility, delayed germination, as well as late flowering.
 Delayed germination was largely rescued by application of SAM in the knockdown lines.
 Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression ofthe flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT_like genes).
 Moreover,the histone H3K4me3 and symmetric DNA methylation at these genes were greatly reduced.
 Thus, SAM deficiency suppressing DNA and H3K4me3 transmethylations at flowering key genes led to a late_flowering phenotype in rice.
 Expression analysis by semi_quantitative PCR or quantitative real_time PCR showed that OsRCCR1 transcripts were much more abundant than OsRCCR2, and all of these genes were upregulated during senescence and following wound treatment.
 RNA interference knockdown of OsPAO led to pheophorbide a accumulation in leaves (especially dark_induced senescent leaves) and leaf death from regeneration stage onwards,even transgenic plants inviability after transplantation.
 While, knockdown of OsRCCR1 resulted in lesionmimic spots generation in older leaves which died off early in the transgenic plants.
 These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses.
 The OsPR4 proteins have high sequence similarity to reported PR4 proteins from monocotyledonous species and are predicted to be class II PR4 proteins.
 Except for OsPR4e, which was not detected with any transcript, the other four OsPR4 genes showed diverse temporal–spatial expression patterns, and their expressions are responsive to Magnaporthe grisea infection.
 Interestingly, the OsPR4 genes are also responsive to abiotic stresses.
 The transcript levels of OsPR4 genes were also induced by some phytohormones such as abscisic acid and jasmonic acid.
 We conclude that rice PR4 genes are also involved in abiotic stress responses and tolerance in addition to their responsiveness to pathogen attacks.
 HS_induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS_induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2.
7_OE transgenic lines demonstrated higher germination ability compared to wild_type (WT) plants when subjected to mannitol and NaCl.
The Stay_Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark_induced leaf senescence.
 An SGR homologue, SGR_like (SGRL),has been detected in many plant species.
We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark_induced senescence.
 As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases.
 Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl_binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark_induced senescence leaves in rice.
 Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation.
 The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light_harvesting Chl a/b_binding protein are also discussed.
 To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice.
 In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue.
 These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 50_flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin.
 The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment.
 OsBLE3 transcript levels were greatly reduced in brd1 plants, a BL deficient mutant,compared to the wild type control.
 In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR_insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector.
Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants.
 Internode cell length of the OsBLE3 antisense transgenic lines was about 70% of that in the vacant vector transformed control lines.
 These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA.
 Herein, the generation of rice transgenic plants silenced for either both or each one of the cytosolic Apx1 and Apx2 genes was carried out in order to investigate the importance of cytosolic Apx isoforms on plant development and on plant stress responses.
 On the other hand, silencing OsApx1 and OsApx2 genes individually resulted in strong effect on plant development producing semi_dwarf phenotype.
Functional complementation of the yeast mutant DPop6 established that OsAlba1 also functions in oxidative stress tolerance.
 The preferential expression of OsAlba1 in the flag leaves implies its role in grain filling.
 This hypothesis was tested using antisense lines of the salt responsive OsSUT1 gene in the salt sensitive Taipei 309 cultivar.
 Two independent OsSUT1 lines with an antisense inhibition similar to the naturally occurring salt induced reduction of OsSUT1 gene expression showed these phenomena but not a more extreme antisense inhibition line.
We generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHAP3E which encodes a subunit of a CCAAT_motif binding HAP complex.
 These phenotypes indicate association of OsHAP3E with determination of floral meristem identity.
 On the other hand, repression of OsHAP3E by RNAi or by overexpressing chimeric repressor fusion constructs brought about lethality to transformed cells, and almost no transformant was obtained.
 This suggests that the OsHAP3E function is essential for rice cells.
 Altogether, our lossof_function and gain_of_function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice.
 In this study, we characterized the OsTLP27 gene from rice (Oryza sativa), which encodes a 27_kDa of 257_amino acid with 53% homology to the AtTLP gene from Arabidopsis thaliana.
 OsTLP27 was predicted to encode a thylakoid lumen protein of unknown function in chloroplast, and chloroplast targeting of OsTLP27 was confirmed by transient expression of a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP).
 OsTLP27 transcripts accumulated specifically in green tissues such as the leaf blade and leaf sheath, and the levels of its transcripts followed a circadian rhythm.
 Constitutive expression of OsTLP27 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter resulted in increased pigment content and enhanced photochemical efficiency in terms of the values of maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), effective quantum yield of PSII (PSII), electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching (qP).
 Overexpression of OsTLP27 also enhanced transcript levels of genes related to chloroplast function and caused changes in the grana size and number.
 These data suggested that OsTLP27 encodes a protein with a novel function in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice.
 OsMIOX was expressed predominantly in the roots and induced by drought, H2O2, salt, cold and abscisic acid.
 The transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsMIOX showed obviously improved growth performance in the medium containing 200 mM mannitol.
 Together, these data suggest that OsMIOX has a specific function in drought stress tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage.
 Here we characterized an ornithine ı_aminotransferase gene OsOAT that confers multi_stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa).
 We confirmed that OsOAT is a direct target of the stress_responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2.
 OsOAT is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments.
 Overexpression of the OsOAT gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance.
 Overexpression of OsOAT caused significantly increased ı_OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions.
 We conclude that OsOAT is a target gene of SNAC2 and confers stress tolerance mainly through enhancing ROS_scavenging capacity and Pro pre_accumulation.
We have identified a gene, SHORT LATERAL ROOT LENGTH1 (SLL1), which is important for the elongation of lateral roots in rice.
 An sll1 mutant has decreased lateral root growth due to a defect in the cell elongation.
The SLL1 gene encodes a member ofthe stearoyl_acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family thatis the key regulator of overall fatty acid desaturation in plants.
 Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage.
We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice.
 These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H2O2 generation.
 The rice XA21 immune receptor confers resistance to the Gram_negative bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo).
 To identify components that mediate XA21_mediated signaling, we performed co_purification experiments using C_terminal GFP tagged XA21 protein.
 Silencing of the SDF2 genes in the XA21 rice genetic background compromises resistance to Xoo but does not affect plant growth and development.
 OsDET1 was richly expressed in green tissues, and its expression seems to be under circadian control.
 OsDET1_GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells showed that OsDET1 localized to the nucleus.
 These results indicated that OsDET1 mutation in Gc mutant increases Chl content in rice, which might be fundamental for enhanced photoresponsiveness.
 The protein profile of OsGAPDHB showed only a weak correlation to its transcription profile.
 This result indicated that the reduction of OsGAPDHB in SA0420 is regulated by post_translational processes and can only be analyzed by proteomics approach.
 Transgenic lines suppressing OsGAPDHB through RNAi harbored more fragrance than TNG67 butless than SA0420.
 With betaine_aldehyde dehydrogenase as the only fragrance gene identified in rice to date, OsGAPDHB may serve as the second protein known to contribute to the aroma phenotype.
 In this study, we have generated double knockdown rice (Oryza sativa L, plants in both OsAPX7 (sAPX) and OsAPX8 (tAPX) genes, which encode chloroplastic APXs (chlAPXs).
 Here, we investigated the expression patterns and roles of an S_like RNase gene, OsRNS4, in abscisic acid (ABA)_mediated responses and phytochrome_mediated light responses as well as salinity tolerance in rice.
 The OsRNS4 gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves although its transcripts were detected in various organs.
 OsRNS4 expression was regulated by salt, PEG and ABA.
 The seedlings overexpressing OsRNS4 had longer coleoptiles and first leaves than wild_type seedlings under red light(R) and far_red light(FR), suggesting negative regulation of OsRNS4 in photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings.
 Moreover, ABA_induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was significantly increased in the OsRNS4_overexpression (OsRNS4_OX) lines compared with that in WT, suggesting that OsRNS4 probably acts as a positive regulator in ABA responses in rice seedlings.
 Our findings supply new evidence on the functions of monocot S_like RNase in regulating photosensitivity and abiotic stress responses.
The chloroplast development governs plant growth and metabolism.
 This study characterized a novel rice thermo_sensitive chloroplast development 9 (tcd9) mutant, which exhibited the albino phenotype before the 3_leaf stage grown below 24 ◦C whereas displayed normal green at over 28 ◦C or even at 20 ◦C after 5_leaf stage.
 The map_based cloning and molecular complementation tests revealed that the mutation of TCD9 encoding  subunit of Cpn60 protein (Cpn60), localized in chloroplasts, was responsible for albino phenotype.
 In addition, TCD9 exhibited the high expression in all tested tissues,especially in young leaves.
 The transcriptional analysis indicated that all expression levels of the studied genes related to chloroplast development in tcd9 mutant were seriously affected in the albino seedlings at 20 ◦C, whereas some ofthem recovered into normal levels in green_seedlings at 32 ◦C.
 Our observations suggest that the nuclear_encoded Cpn60 protein TCD9 plays a crucial role in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
 However, phylogenetic analyses and gene expression studies demonstrated greater association of OsaLeg2 and OsaLeg3 to seedrelated legumains, whereas OsaLeg1, 4 and 5 would act as vegetative_related proteases.
 Additionally, OsaLeg1 mRNA is strongly induced in senescent leaves.
 Alternative splicing isoforms,with potential to generate pre_activated OsaLeg1 and OsaLeg2 nonvacuolar enzymes under different environmental situations were also observed.
 Reduced potassium and elevated sodium in field_grown plants were evident in rcn1 compared to original line ‘Shiokari’ and four independent rcnmutants, rcn2, rcn4, rcn5 and rcn6.
Ahigh Na/Kratio was evidentin the shoots and roots of rcn1 under K starvation and salt stress in hydroponically cultured plants.
Downregulation of SKC1/OsHKT1;5 in rcn1 shoots under salt stress demonstrated that normal function of RCN1/OsABCG5 is essential for upregulation of SKC1/OsHKT1;5 under salt stress.
 The accumulation of various minerals in shoots and roots was also altered in the rcn1 mutant compared to ‘Shiokari’ under control conditions, potassium starvation, and salt and d_sorbitol treatments.
 The rcn1 mutation resulted in a salt_sensitive phenotype.
 The progeny ofthe heterozygote of disrupted OsSPS1 (SPS1+/−) segregated into SPS1+/+, SPS1+/−, and SPS1−/− at a ratio of 1.
 By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt_induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3.
 Of these Rops, OsRac1 is the only characterized gene that has been implicated in disease resistance as a positive regulator.
 To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a “phylogeny of function” approach to rice Rops, and identified OsRacB based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance.
 To determine the function of OsRacB, we isolated the OsRacB cDNA and conducted gene expression and transgenic studies.
 The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two_week_old seedlings was strongly down_regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid.
 A dramatic down_regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea.
 Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over_expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens.
 Here we report characterization of the OVP1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 Quantitative reverse transcriptase_polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT_qPCR) showed that OVP1 was induced by cold stress.
 OVP1 overexpression resulted in enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic rice, which was related to an increased integrity of cell membrane, decreased MDA content and accumulation of proline to higher level as compared with wild type rice seedlings.
 Here, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen_responsive rice OsCPK10 gene.
 The expression of OsCPK10 was strongly induced following treatment with a Magnaporthe grisea elicitor.
 Kinase activity assay showed that the functional OsCPK10 protein not only autophosphorylated, but also phosphorylated Casein in a calcium_dependent manner.
 Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 in Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv.
Similarly, transgenic rice plants containing constitutively active OsCPK10 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast fungus M.
 Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA_ and JA_dependent defense responses.
 We found that the AM symbiosis down_regulated OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;3 expression at low_N, but not at high_N conditions, and induced, independently of the N status of the plant, a strong up_regulation of OsAMT3;1 expression.
 The AM_inducible NHþ 4 transporter OsAMT3;1 belongs to the family 2 of plant AMTs and is phylogenetically related to the AM_inducible AMTs of other plant species.
 These data suggest that OsAMT3;1 is likely involved in the mycorrhizal N uptake pathway in rice roots and that OsGOGAT2 plays a role in the assimilation of the NHþ 4 supplied via the OsAMT3;1 AM_inducible transporter.
 OsMYB4P was localized in the nucleus and acted as a transcriptional activator.
 Transcriptional levels of OsMYB4P in cell suspension, shoots, and roots of rice increased under phosphate_deficient conditions.
 In addition, root system architecture was altered considerably as a result of OsMYB4P overexpression.
 Overexpression of OsMYB4P led to greater expression of Pi transporter_family proteins OsPT1, OsPT2, OsPT4, OsPT7, and OsPT8 in shoots, and to decreased or unchanged expression of these proteins in roots, with the exception of OsPT8.
 These results demonstrate that OsMYB4P may be associated with efficient utilization of Pi in rice through transcriptional activation of Pi homeostasis_related genes.
A drought_suppressed cDNA (RiP_3), encoding a putative a_tubulin protein was isolated from rice panicle at pollen_mother_cell meiosis stage.
 Given the known critical role of tubulin in cell division and elongation, the results indicate that the expression of a_tubulin gene may be part of the events that suppress panicle elongation during water deficit, which is in turn a suspected cause of male reproductive failure and yield reduction in rice.
 Here we showed how a rice myosin gene controlled pollen development by sensing changed environmental factors.
 This mutant showed male sterility under short day length (SD) conditions and fertility under long day length (LD) conditions.
 Under both SD and LD conditions, the OSMYOXIB transcript was detected in whole anthers.
As a result, mutant pollen development was affected, leading to male sterility.
 Despite normal localization, the protein was only partially functional due to the lack of DIL domain sequences, resulting in limited recovery of pollen fertility.
 To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves.
 adl1 leaves are covered with bulliform_like cells, which are normally distributed only on the adaxial surface.
 An adl1 double mutant with the adaxially snowy leaf mutant, which has albino cells that specifically appear in the abaxial mesophyll tissue, indicated that adl1 leaves show adaxialization in both epidermal and mesophyll tissues.
The expression of HD_ZIPIII genes in adl1 mutant increased in mature leaves, but not in the young primordia or the SAM.
 This indicated that ADL1 may not be directly involved in determining initial leaf polarity, but rather is associated with the maintenance of axis information.
 ADL1 encodes a plant_specific calpain_like cysteine proteinase orthologous to maize DEFECTIVE KERNEL1.
 Furthermore, we identified intermediate and strong alleles of the adl1 mutant that generate shootless embryos and globular_arrested embryos with aleurone layer loss, respectively.
 We propose that ADL1 plays an important role in pattern formation of the leaf and embryo by promoting proper epidermal development.
Grasses have highly specialized flowers and their outer floral organ identity remains unclear.
 The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants.
 In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration.
 Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1(SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size.
 We identified the DP1 gene by map_based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear_localized AT_hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass_specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development.
 The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor.
Drought is very harmful to grain yield due to its adverse effect on reproduction, especially on pollination process in rice.
 RNA interference_mediated suppression of OsCIPK23 expression significantly reduced seed set and conferred a hypersensitive response to drought stress, indicating its possible roles in pollination and drought stress.
 In consistent, overexpression of OsCIPK23 induced the expression of several drought tolerance related genes.
 Taken together, these results indicate that OsCIPK23 is a multistress induced gene and likely mediates a signaling pathway commonly shared by both pollination and drought stress responses in rice.
8 kb upstream of the OsGA2ox6 in the H032 genome by TAIL_PCR.
 An increased level of OsGA2ox6 mRNA was detected at a high level in the H032 mutant, which might be due to the enhancer role of the CaMV 35S promoter.
 RNAi and ectopic expression analysis of OsGA2ox6 indicated that the dwarf trait and the decreased levels of bioactive GAs in the H032 mutant were a result of the up_regulation of the OsGA2ox6 gene.
 BLASTP analysis revealed that OsGA2ox6 belongs to the class III of GA 2_oxidases, which is a novel type of GA2ox that uses C20_GAs (GA12 and/or GA53) as the substrates.
 Interestingly, we found that a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol, positively regulated the OsGA2ox6 gene.
 These results indicate that OsGA2ox6 mainly affects plant stature, and the dominant dwarf trait of the H032 mutant can be used as an efficient dwarf resource in rice breeding.
 OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31_eGFP fusion protein.
 Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA_binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast.
 Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M.
 grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild_type and RNAi plants.
 Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4_D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport.
 These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.
Previous studies have demonstrated the possible role of several aquaporins in seed germination.
 The expression patterns of the PIPs suggest these aquaporins play different roles in seed germination and seedling growth.
 Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over_expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water_stress conditions.
 Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination.
 Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds.
 These results suggest that water channels play an important role in seed germination, acting, at least partly, in response to the NO signaling pathway.
Tiller angle of rice (Oryza sativa L, is an important agronomic trait that contributes to grain production, and has long attracted attentions of breeders for achieving ideal plant architecture to improve grain yield.
 Although enormous efforts have been made over the past decades to study mutants with extremely spreading or compact tillers, the molecular mechanism underlying the control of tiller angle of cereal crops remains unknown.
 Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled.
 We show that LA1, a novel grass_specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT).
 Loss_of_function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller_spreading phenotype of rice plants.
 Transgenic studies have shown that the suppressed expression of rice PLDβ1 results in reduced sensitivity to exogenous ABA during seed germination.
 Further analysis of the expression of ABA signaling_related genes has revealed that PLDβ1 stimulates ABA signaling by activating SAPK, thus repressing GAmyb expression and inhibiting seed germination.
The rice Eui (ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE) gene encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that deactivates bioactive gibberellins (GAs).
 In this study, we investigated controlled expression of the Eui gene and its role in plant development.
 We found that Eui was differentially induced by exogenous GAs and that the Eui promoter had the highest activity in the vascular bundles.
 The eui mutant was defective in starch granule development in root caps and Eui overexpression enhanced starch granule generation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses.
 Experiments using embryoless half_seeds revealed that RAmy1A and GAmyb were highly upregulated in eui aleurone cells in the absence of exogenous GA.
 In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings.
 These results indicate that EUI is involved in GA homeostasis, not only in the internodes at the heading stage, but also in the seedling stage, roots and seeds.
 Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1.
 Transgenic RNA interference of the Eui gene effectively increased plant height and improved heading performance.
 By contrast, the ectopic expression of Eui under the promoters of the rice GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2 significantly reduced plant height.
 These results demonstrate that a slight increase in Eui expression could dramatically change rice morphology, indicating the practical application of the Eui gene in rice molecular breeding for a high yield potential.
In the monocot rice species Oryza sativa L, one of the most striking morphological processes during reproductive development is the concurrence of panicle development with the sequential elongation of upper internodes (UPIs).
 To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (NL1), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns.
 The NL1 gene encodes a GATA_type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild_type plants.
 Overexpression of NL1 in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that NL1 plays an important role in organ differentiation.
 A novel mutant allele of PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1), a gene known to play a key role in regulating leaf initiation, was identified in this study.
 Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1.
 The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant.
 Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant.
 On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.
 These mutants exhibited reduced numbers of lateral roots (LRs) and partial loss of gravitropism.
 The mutants also displayed enhanced sensitivity to N_1_naphthylphthalamic acid, an inhibitor of polar auxin transport (PAT), indicating that the mutations affected auxin transport.
As an important agronomic trait, inclination of leaves is crucial for crop architecture and grain yields.
 To understand the molecular mechanism controlling rice leaf angles, one rice leaf inclination2 (lc2, three alleles) mutant was identified and functionally characterized.
 Compared to wild_type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint.
 The LC2 gene was isolated through positional cloning, and encodes a vernalization insensitive 3_like protein.
 Complementary expression of LC2 reversed the enlarged leaf angles of lc2 plants, confirming its role in controlling leaf inclination.
 LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids.
 LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone_responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects.
The architecture of the panicle, including grain size and panicle morphology, directly determines grain yield.
 Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified.
 DEP2 encodes a plant_specific protein without any known functional domain.
 Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles.
 Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia.
 Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle.
 Despite a more compact plant type in the dep2 mutant, no significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and dep2 mutant.
 Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding.
 The expression of OsBBI1 was induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, as well as chemical inducers, benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid.
 Biochemical analysis revealed that OsBBI1 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.
 Genetic analysis revealed that the loss of OsBBI1 function in a Tos17_insertion line increased susceptibility, while the overexpression of OsBBI1 in transgenic plants conferred enhanced resistance to multiple races of M.
 This indicates that OsBBI1 modulates broad_spectrum resistance against the blast fungus.
 oryzae compared with wild_type (WT) plants.
 Our results suggest that OsBBI1 modulates broad_spectrum resistance to blast fungus by modifying cell wall defence responses.
 The functional characterization of OsBBI1 provides insight into the E3 ligase_mediated innate immunity, and a practical tool for constructing broad_spectrum resistance against the most destructive disease in rice.
The events occurring at the onset of meiosis have not been fully elucidated.
 In the present study, OsAM1 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L, by map_based cloning.
 In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene_zygotene transition.
 Immunocytological analysis revealed that OsAM1 exists as foci in early prophase I meiocytes.
 Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8.
 In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes.
 In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis.
 Grain weight is a key component of rice yield, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that control it remain elusive.
 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a new quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the control of rice grain length, weight and yield.
1_WY3 influences protein phosphorylation in the spikelet to accelerate cell division, thereby resulting in longer grains and higher yields.
 Our findings suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of grain size and yield that is driven through a novel phosphatase_mediated process that affects the phosphorylation of Cyclin_T1;3 during cell cycle progression, and thus provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying crop seed development.
1 allele that demonstrated increased grain yield, which indicates that GL3.
 However, little is known about the induction mechanism of HR cell death.
 We report that overexpression of OsNAC4, which encodes a plant_specific transcription factor, leads to HR cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation and typical morphological changes.
 In OsNAC4 knock_down lines, HR cell death is markedly decreased in response to avirulent bacterial strains.
 After induction by an avirulent pathogen recognition signal, OsNAC4 is translocated into the nucleus in a phosphorylation_dependent manner.
 A microarray analysis showed that the expression of 139 genes including OsHSP90 and IREN, encoding a Ca2 þ _dependent nuclease, were different between the OsNAC4 knock_down line and control line during HR cell death.
 During the induction of HR cell death, OsHSP90 is involved in the loss of plasma membrane integrity,whereas IREN causes nuclear DNA fragmentation.
Overall, our results indicate that two important events occurring during HR cell death are regulated by independent pathways.
el1 had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of EL1 expression by exogenous GA3.
Biochemical characterization showed that EL1 specifically phosphorylates the rice DELLA protein SLR1, proving a direct evidence for SLR1 phosphorylation.
 Overexpression of SLR1 in wild_type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function.
 Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of SLR1 is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of SLR1 results in the altered GA signalling.
 This study shows EL1 a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development.
Tillering in rice (Oryza sativa L, is an important agronomic trait for grain production, and also a model system for the study of branching in monocotyledonous plants.
 Rice tillering occurs in a two_stage process.
 Here, we report the cloning of the R gene Xa27 from rice and the cognate avr gene avrXa27 from Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 Resistant and susceptible alleles of Xa27 encode identical proteins.
 Induction of Xa27 occurs only in the immediate vicinity of infected tissue, whereas ectopic expression of Xa27 resulted in resistance to otherwise compatible strains of the pathogen.
 Thus Xa27 specificity towards incompatible pathogens involves the differential expression of the R gene in the presence of the AvrXa27 effector.
 Recombinant glutathione S_transferase (GST)–GID1 had a high affinity only for biologically active GAs, whereas mutated GST–GID1 corresponding to three gid1 alleles had no GA_binding affinity.
 Moreover, GID1 bound to SLR1, a rice DELLA protein, in a GA_dependent manner in yeast cells.
 GID1 overexpression resulted in a GA_hypersensitive phenotype.
 Together, our results indicate that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signalling in rice.
 Lsi1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells, where casparian strips are located.
 Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake.
 Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only.
 LOG encodes a novel cytokinin_activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis.
 Revising the long_held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free_base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokininspecific phosphoribohydrolase activity.
 LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain.
 The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells.
 Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter.
 Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase,whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL_mediated degradation.
 Moreover, D53 can interact with transcriptional co_repressors known as TOPLESS_RELATED PROTEINS.
 Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL_dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14–D3 complex.
 We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild_type plants, is caused by a gain_of_function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment.
The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the a/b hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F_box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception.
 We demonstrate that, in a D14_ and D3_dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth.
 Our combined genetic and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling pathway, whose hormone_induced degradation represents a key molecular link between SL perception and responses.
 Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure.
 A nearisogenic line carrying SCM2 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene.
 Although SCM2 is a gain_of_function mutant of APO1, it does not have the negative effects reported for APO1 overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology.
Plant growth and development are sustained by continuous cell division in the meristems, which is perturbed by various environmental stresses.
 For the maintenance of meristematic functions, it is essential that cell division be coordinated with cell differentiation.
 However, it is unknown how the proliferative activities of the meristems and the coordination between cell division and differentiation are maintained under stressful conditions.
 These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1–S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin.
 RSS1 is conserved widely in plant lineages, except eudicots, suggesting that RSS1_dependent mechanisms might have been adopted in specific lineages during the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.
 Homozygous knockout of MIT in this line resulted in a lethal phenotype.
 MIT localized to the mitochondria and complemented the growth of ∆mrs3∆mrs4 yeast defective in mitochondrial Fe transport.
 These results indicate that MIT is a mitochondrial Fe transporter essential for rice growth and development.
Rice MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) and its orthologues LS/LAS (lateral suppressor in tomato and Arabidopsis) are key promoting factors of shoot branching and tillering in higher plants.
 Here we show that the rice tiller enhancer (te) mutant displays a drastically increased tiller number.
 We demonstrate that TE encodes a rice homologue of Cdh1, and that TE acts as an activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex.
 We show that TE coexpresses with MOC1 in the axil of leaves, where the APC/CTE complex mediates the degradation of MOC1 by the ubiquitin–26S proteasome pathway, and consequently downregulates the expression of the meristem identity gene Oryza sativa homeobox 1, thus repressing axillary meristem initiation and formation.
 We conclude that besides having a conserved role in regulating cell cycle, APC/CTE has a unique function in regulating the plant_specific postembryonic shoot branching and tillering, which are major determinants of plant architecture and grain yield.
Rice tillering is a multigenic trait that influences grain yield, but its regulation molecular module is poorly understood.
 Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
 An activation_tagged mutant osmads57_1 and OsMADS57_overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas OsMADS57 antisense lines had fewer tillers.
 OsMIR444a_overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed OsMADS57 expression and tillering.
 Furthermore,osmads57_1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57’s function in tillering was dependent on D14.
 D14 expression was downregulated in osmads57_1, but upregulated in antisense and OsMIR444a_overexpressing lines.
OsMADS57 bound to the CArG motif [C(A/T)TTAAAAAG] in the promoter and directly suppressed D14 expression.
 Interaction of OsMADS57 with OsTB1 reduced OsMADS57 inhibition of D14 transcription.
 Therefore, OsMIR444a_regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering.
 This regulation mechanism could have important application in rice molecular breeding programs focused on high grain yield.
 OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity.
 OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions.
 These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron_binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency.
Grain number, panicle seed setting rate, panicle number and grain weight are the most important components of rice grain yield.
 To date, several genes related to grain weight, grain number and panicle number have been described in rice.
 However, no genes regulating the panicle seed setting rate have been functionally characterized.
 Here we show that the domestication_related POLLEN TUBE BLOCKED 1 (PTB1), a RING_type E3 ubiquitin ligase,positively regulates the rice panicle seed setting rate by promoting pollen tube growth.
 The natural variation in expression of PTB1 which is affected by the promoter haplotype and the environmental temperature, correlates with the rice panicle seed setting rate.
 Our results support the hypothesis that PTB1 is an important maternal sporophytic factor of pollen tube growth and a key modulator of the rice panicle seed setting rate.
 Hybrid weakness, the poorer development of hybrids compared with their parents, hinders gene exchange between different species at the postzygotic stage.
 Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperaturedependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice.
 Hwi1 comprises two leucine_rich repeat receptor_like kinase (LRR–RLK) genes, 25L1 and 25L2, which are specific to wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and induce hybrid weakness.
 Functional analysis indicated that pyramiding of Hwi1 and Hwi2 activates the autoimmune response in the basal nodes of hybrids, interrupting root formation and then impairing shoot growth.
 qPC1 encodes a putative amino acid transporter OsAAP6, which functions as a positive regulator of GPC in rice, such that higher expression of OsAAP6 is correlated with higher GPC.
 OsAAP6 greatly enhances root absorption of a range of amino acids and has effects on the distribution of various amino acids.
 Two common variations in the potential cis_regulatory elements of the OsAAP6 5'_untranslated region seem to be associated with GPC diversity mainly in indica cultivars.
Yield potential, plant height and heading date are three classes of traits that determine the productivity of many crop plants.
Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) Ghd7, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date.
Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long_day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size.
 Thus, Ghd7 has played crucial roles for increasing productivity and adaptability of rice globally.
 This evolutionary step importantly improved plant architecture and increased grain yield.
 Here we find that prostrate growth of wild rice from Yuanjiang County in China is controlled by a semi_dominant gene, PROG1 (PROSTRATE GROWTH 1), on chromosome 7 that encodes a single Cys2_His2 zinc_finger protein.
 prog1 variants identified in O.
 sativa disrupt the prog1 function and inactivate prog1 expression, leading to erect growth, greater grain number and higher grain yield in cultivated rice.
 Sequence comparison shows that 182 varieties of cultivated rice, including 87 indica and 95 japonica cultivars from 17 countries, carry identical mutations in the prog1 coding region that may have become fixed during rice domestication.
Grain_filling, an important trait that contributes greatly to grain weight, is regulated by quantitative trait loci and is associated with crop domestication syndrome1–4.
 Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of the rice GIF1 (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1)gene that encodes a cell_wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain_filling.
 The cultivated GIF1 gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain_filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene’s regulatory sequence through domestication.
 Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice GIF1 is responsible for grain weight reduction.
 Ectopic expression of the cultivated GIF1 gene with the 35S or rice Waxy promoter resulted in smaller grains,whereas overexpression of GIF1 driven by its native promoter increased grain production.
 These findings, together with the domestication signature that we identified by comparing nucleotide diversity of the GIF1 loci between cultivated and wild rice, strongly suggest that GIF1 is a potential domestication gene and that such a domestication_selected gene can be used for further crop improvement.
A key step during crop domestication is the loss of seed shattering.
 Here, we show that seed shattering in sorghum is controlled by a single gene, Shattering1 (Sh1), which encodes a YABBY transcription factor.
 Our results indicate that Sh1 genes for seed shattering were under parallel selection during sorghum, rice and maize domestication.
Grain size and shape are important components of grain yield and quality and have been under selection since cereals were first domesticated.
 Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus GW8 is synonymous with OsSPL16, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of cell proliferation.
 Higher expression of this gene promotes cell division and grain filling, with positive consequences for grain width and yield in rice.
 The correlation between grain size and allelic variation at the GW8 locus suggests that mutations within the promoter region were likely selected in rice breeding programs.
 We also show that a markerassisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield.
 Here we show that the PROG1 gene controls aspects of wild_rice plant architecture, including tiller angle and number of tillers.
 PROG1 is predominantly expressed in the axillary meristems, the site of tiller bud formation.
 Rice transformation experiments demonstrate that artificial selection of an amino acid substitution in the PROG1 protein during domestication led to the transition from the plant architecture of wild rice to that of domesticated rice.
Reduction in seed shattering was an important phenotypic change during cereal domestication1,2.
 In the wild genetic background of rice,we found that plants with a cultivated_like type of closed panicle had significantly reduced seed shedding through seed retention.
 In addition, the long awns in closed panicles disturbed the free exposure of anthers and stigmas on the flowering spikelets, resulting in a significant reduction of the outcrossing rate.
 Our results suggest that a closed panicle was a selected trait during rice domestication.
 Grain weight is a major determining factor of yield.
 Here, we report the cloning and functional analysis of THOUSAND_GRAIN WEIGHT 6 (TGW6), a gene from the Indian landrace rice Kasalath.
 TGW6 encodes a novel protein with indole_3_acetic acid (IAA)_glucose hydrolase activity.
In sink organs, the Nipponbare tgw6 allele affects the timing of the transition from the syncytial to the cellular phase by controlling IAA supply and limiting cell number and grain length.
 Most notably, loss of function of the Kasalath allele enhances grain weight through pleiotropic effects on source organs and leads to significant yield increases.
 Our findings suggest that TGW6 may be useful for further improvements in yield characteristics in most cultivars.
 Here we demonstrate that alteration of root system architecture improves drought avoidance through the cloning and characterization of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1), a rice quantitative trait locus controlling root growth angle.
 DRO1 is negatively regulated by auxin and is involved in cell elongation in the root tip that causes asymmetric root growth and downward bending of the root in response to gravity.
 Higher expression of DRO1 increases the root growth angle, whereby roots grow in a more downward direction.
 Introducing DRO1 into a shallow_rooting rice cultivar by backcrossing enabled the resulting line to avoid drought by increasing deep rooting,which maintained high yield performance under drought conditions relative to the recipient cultivar.
 Our experiments suggest that control of root system architecture will contribute to drought avoidance in crops.
Grain chalkiness is a highly undesirable quality trait in the marketing and consumption of rice grain1–6.
Here we show that a major quantitative trait locus (QTL),Chalk5, influences grain chalkiness, which also affects head rice yield and many other quality traits.
 Chalk5 encodes a vacuolar H+_translocating pyrophosphatase (V_PPase) with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis and H+_translocation activity.
 Elevated expression of Chalk5 increases the chalkiness of the endosperm, putatively by disturbing the pH homeostasis of the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds,which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies and is coupled with a great increase in small vesicle_like structures,thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances and resulting in chalky grain.
 Our results indicate that two consensus nucleotide polymorphisms in the Chalk5 promoter in rice varieties might partly account for the differences in Chalk5 mRNA levels that contribute to natural variation in grain chalkiness.
 Here we show that a major rice nitrogen_use efficiency quantitative trait locus (qNGR9) is synonymous with the previously identified gene DEP1 (DENSE AND ERECT PANICLES 1).
 The different DEP1 alleles confer different nitrogen responses, and genetic diversity analysis suggests that DEP1 has been subjected to artificial selection during Oryza sativa spp.
The plants carrying the dominant dep1_1 allele exhibit nitrogeninsensitive vegetative growth coupled with increased nitrogen uptake and assimilation, resulting in improved harvest index and grain yield at moderate levels of nitrogen fertilization.
 The DEP1 protein interacts in vivo with both the Ga (RGA1) and Gb (RGB1) subunits, and reduced RGA1 or enhanced RGB1activity inhibits nitrogen responses.
 We conclude that the plant G protein complex regulates nitrogen signaling and modulation of heterotrimeric G protein activity provides a strategy for environmentally sustainable increases in rice grain yield.
Grain yield is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in many crop plants.
 Here we report the molecular characterization of a major rice grain yield QTL that acts through the determination of panicle architecture.
 The dominant allele at the DEP1 locus is a gain_of_function mutation causing truncation of a phosphatidylethanolamine_binding protein_like domain protein.
The effect of this allele is to enhance meristematic activity,resulting in a reduced length of the inflorescence internode,an increased number of grains per panicle and a consequent increase in grain yield.
 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a semidominant quantitative trait locus,IPA1 (Ideal Plant Architecture 1), which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and substantially enhances rice grain yield.
 The IPA1 quantitative trait locus encodes OsSPL14 (SOUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN_LIKE 14)and is regulated by microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR156 in vivo.
We demonstrate that a point mutation in OsSPL14 perturbs OsmiR156_directed regulation of OsSPL14, generating an ‘ideal’ rice plant with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield.
 Our study suggests that OsSPL14 may help improve rice grain yield by facilitating the breeding of new elite rice varieties.
 Here we show that the quantitative trait locus WFP (WEALTHY FARMER’S PANICLE) encodes OsSPL14 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN_LIKE 14,also known as IPA1).
 Higher expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching and higher grain yield in rice.
 Grain size is a major determinant of grain yield in cereals and is a target trait for both domestication and artificial breeding1.
 We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight.
 GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size.
The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops2.
 To understand the molecular basis of this QTL, we isolated the SKC1 gene by map_based cloning and found that it encoded a member of HKT_type transporters.
 SKC1 is preferentially expressed in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels.
 Voltage_clamp analysis showed that SKC1 protein functions as a Na+_selective transporter.
 Physiological analysis suggested that SKC1 is involved in regulating K+/Na+ homeostasis under salt stress,providing a potential tool for improving salt tolerance in crops.
Grain weight is one of the most important components of grain yield and is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in crops.
 However, the molecular roles of QTLs in the regulation of grain weight have not been fully elucidated.
 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight.
Our data show that GW2 encodes a previously unknown RING_type protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is known to function in the degradation by the ubiquitin_proteasome pathway.
 Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield.
Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis.
 The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops.
 Mutants with abnormal leaf developmental patterns not only provide a great insight into understanding the regulatory mechanism of plant architecture, but also enrich the ways to its modification by which crop yield could be improved.
 Here, we reported the characterization of the rice leafy_head2 (lhd2) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron, dwarfism, reduced tiller number, and failure of phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.
 Anatomical and histological study revealed that the rapid emergence of leaves in lhd2 was resulted from the rapid initiation of leaf primordia whereas the reduced tiller number was a consequence of the suppression of the tiller bud outgrowth.
 The molecular and genetic analysis showed that LHD2 encodes a putative RNA binding protein with 67% similarity to maize TE1.
 Comparison of genome_scale expression profiles between wild_type and lhd2 plants suggested that LHD2 may regulate rice shoot development through KNOX and hormone_related genes.
 The similar phenotypes caused by LHD2 mutation and the conserved expression pattern of LHD2 indicated a conserved mechanism in controlling the temporal leaf initiation in grass.
 The OsHKT2;1 (previously named OsHKT1) transporter from rice functions as a relatively Na þ _selective transporter in heterologous expression systems, but the in vivo function of OsHKT2;1 remains unknown.
 OsHKT2;1 was mainly expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots.
 These analyses demonstrate that Na þ can enhance growth of rice under K þ starvation conditions, and that OsHKT2;1 is the central transporter for nutritional Na þ uptake into K þ_starved rice roots.
 Here we show that the quantitative trait locus GPS (GREEN FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS) in rice (Oryza sativa L, controls photosynthesis rate by regulating carboxylation efficiency.
 Map_based cloning revealed that GPS is identical to NAL1 (NARROW LEAF1), a gene previously reported to control lateral leaf growth.
 The high_photosynthesis allele of GPS was found to be a partial loss_of_function allele of NAL1.
 This allele increased mesophyll cell number between vascular bundles, which led to thickened leaves, and it pleiotropically enhanced photosynthesis rate without the detrimental side effects observed in previously identified nal1 mutants, such as dwarf plant stature.
 The identification and utilization of NAL1 (GPS) can enhance future high_yield breeding and provides a new strategy for increasing rice productivity.
Heading date is a critical trait for adaptation of rice to different cultivation areas and cropping seasons.
 We evaluated the heading dates of 1,123 chromosome segments substitution lines (CSSLs) in the genetic background of an elite rice variety Huajingxian74 (HJX74).
 A CSSL with the substituted segments from Zihui100 exhibited late heading under both natural long_day (NLD) and natural short_day (NSD) conditions, and the late heading phenotype was controlled by two novel epistatic loci on chromosome 8 and chromosome 3, respectively, termed LH8 and EH3.
 The function of EH3 was dependent on the LH8 genotype through epistatic interaction between EH3Zihui100 and LH8Zihui100 alleles.
 Genetic and molecular characterization revealed LH8 encodes a CCAAT_box_binding transcription factor with Heading date1 (Hd1)_binding activity and may delay flowering by repressing the expression of Early heading date1 (Ehd1).
Our work provides a solid foundation for further study on gene interaction in heading date and has application in breeding rice with greater adaptability.
To clarify the effect of deep rooting on grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L, in an irrigated paddy field with or without fertilizer, we used the shallow_rooting IR64 and the deep_rooting Dro1_NIL (a near_isogenic line homozygous for the Kinandang Patong allele of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) in the IR64 genetic background).
 Although total root length was similar in both lines, more roots were distributed within the lower soil layer of the paddy field in Dro1_NIL than in IR64, irrespective of fertilizer treatment.
 At maturity,Dro1_NIL showed approximately 10% higher grain yield than IR64, irrespective of fertilizer treatment.
Higher grain yield of Dro1_NIL was mainly due to the increased 1000_kernel weight and increased percentage of ripened grains, which resulted in a higher harvest index.
 These results suggest that deep rooting by DRO1 enhances nitrogen uptake and cytokinin fluxes at late stages, resulting in better grain filling in Dro1_NIL in a paddy field in this study.
 GH2 has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2 and encodes cinnamyl_alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD).
 The gh loci in Leaf Star and Chugoku 117 were localized to the same region of chromosome 2 as the gh2 mutant.
 Leaf Star had culms with low lignin concentrations due to a natural mutation in OsCAD2 that was not present in Chugoku 117.
 Our results suggest that rice can be improved for forage and bioenergy production by combining superior lodging resistance, which can be obtained by introducing thick and stiff culm traits, with low lignin concentrations, which can be obtained using the gh2 variety.
 An analysis of Wx transcripts, Wx protein, and amylose content of 31 rice cultivars revealed that endosperm amylose and Wx protein contents are correlated with the ability of the cultivar to excise intron I from the leader sequence of the Wx transcript.
 Cultivars with high endosperm emylose content (group I) contain high levels of amylose, Wx protein, and the mature 2.
3 kb Wx mRNA.
 Cultivars with intermediate amylose content (group II) produce substantial amounts of a large 3.
3 kb Wx pre_mRNA, with intron I still present, in addition to the mature Wx mRNA, and intermediate levels of Wx protein.
 Glutinous rice (group III cuitivars) contains no amylose, no Wx protein, and no mature Wx mRNA; only the incompletely spliced 3.
3 kb Wx pre_mRNA is present in group III cuitivars.
 Based on these results, it is hypothesized that the amylose content of rice endosperm is regulated at the level of Wxtranscript processing, and, more specifically, at the stage of intron I excision from the Wx pre_mRNA.
 Here we describe the isolation and characterization of Pib,one of the rice blast resistance genes.
 The Pib gene was isolated by a map_based cloning strategy.
 The deduced amino acid sequence of the Pib gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine_rich repeats (LRRs); thus, Pib is a member of the NBS_LRR class of plant disease resistance genes.
 Interestingly, a duplication of the kinase 1a, 2 and 3a motifs of the NBS region was found in the N_terminal half of the Pib protein.
 Pib gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.
The photoperiodic sensitivity 5(se5mutant of rice, a short_day plant,，has a very early floweringphenotype and is completely deficient in photoperiodic response.
 We have cloned the SE5 gene bycandidate cloning and demonstrated that it encodes a putative heme oxygenase.
 Lack of responses ofcoleoptile elongation by light pulses and photoreversible phytochromes in crude extracts of se5 indicatethat SE5 may function in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.
 Ectopic expression of SE5 cDNA bythe CcaMV 35S promoter restored the photoperiodic response in the se5 mutant.
Comparison of se5 with hy1, acounterpart mutant of Arabidopsis, suggests distinct roles of phytochromes in the photoperiodic controlof flowering in these two species.
 The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of theseplants correlated well with the level of OsCDPK7 expression.
 To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of in¯orescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs.
 Constitutive overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late_¯owering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1.
Around the SAM, OsPNH1 was strongly expressed in developing leaf primordia, speci®cally in the presumptive vascular domains, developing vascular tissues, a few cell_layers of the adaxial region, and future bundle sheath extension cells.
 In the SAM, only weak expression was observed in the central region, whereas strong expression was detected in the mid_vein region of leaf founder cells in the peripheral SAM domain.
 We produced transgenic rice plants containing the antisense OsPNH1 strand.
The antisense OsPNH1 plants developed malformed leaves with an altered vascular arrangement and abnormal internal structure.
 These plants also formed an aberrant SAM with reduced KNOX gene expression.
 On the basis of these observations, we propose that OsPNH1 functions not only in SAM maintenance as previously thought, but also in leaf formation through vascular development.
The brd1 mutants showed a range of abnormalitiesin organ development and growth, the most striking of which were defects in the elongation of the stemand leaves.
 The accumulation profile of BR com_pounds in the brd1 mutants suggested that these plants may be deficient in the activity of BR C_6 oxidase.
 Introduction of the wild_type OsDWARF gene into brd1 rescued the abnormalphenotype of the mutants.
The OsDWARF gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues,with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolidetreatment.
 The OsHDAC1 gene encoded a protein of approximately 57 kDa that shared 73.
 OsHDAC1 was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity.
 To explore the role of histone deacetylases in transgenic plants, we inserted the OsHDAC1 cDNA fragment into the expression vector Ai.
 Using transformants carrying the QHB promoter_GUS and in situ hybridi_zation, we found that QHB was specifically expressed in the central cells of a quiescent center (QC) of theroot.
 During embryogenesis and crown root formation, QHB expression was observed prior to the mor_phological differentiation of the root.
 However,we detected different OHB expression patterns in theprocess of the RAM development, specifically between radicle and crown root formation, suggesting thatthe cell_fate determination of the QC may be controlled by different mechanisms.
 We also produced trans_formants that overexpress QHB or Arabidopsis WUS.
 These transformants did not form crown roots, butdeveloped multiple shoots from ectopic SAMs with malformed leaves.
Casein kinases are critical in cell division and differentiation across species.
Thephysiological roles of OsCK1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygoustransgenic plants showed abnormal root development,including fewer lateral and adventitious roots,and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation.
 Interestingly, in transgenic andCKI_7_treated plants, exogenously supplied lAA could restore normal root development, and measurementof free lAA content in CKl_deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicat_ing that OsCK1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels.
 In the transgenicrice plants with antisense or RNAi construct of OsHAP3A, reduced expression of not only OsHAP3A but alsoOsHAP3Band OsHAP3Cwas observed.
Arice nuclear gene, Rf_1, restores the pollen fertility disturbed by the BT_type male sterile cytoplasm, and iswidely used for commercial seed production of japonica hybrid varieties.
 Rice Rf_1is the first restorer gene isolatedfrom cereal crops that has the property of reducing the expression of the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)_associated mitochondrial gene like many other restorer genes.
 The present findings may facilitate not onlyelucidating the mechanisms of male sterility by the BT cytoplasm and its restoration by Rf_1 but alsoisolating other restorer genes from cereal crops, especially rice.
 Our results demonstrate that nitrate assimilation is an important process in rice regeneration and also provide an additional selectable marker for rice transformation.
Here, we show that expression of the rice gene Os8N3, a member of the MtN3 gene family from plants and animals, is elevated upon infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae strain PXO99A and depends on the type III effector gene pthXo1.
 Os8N3 resides near xa13, and PXO99A failed to induce Os8N3 in rice lines with xa13.
Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99A yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen.
 The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1.
 oryzae pv.
oryzae commandeers the regulation of otherwise developmentally regulated host genes to induce a state of disease susceptibility.
Here, we show that overexpression of stress responsive gene SNAC1 (STRESS_RESPONSIVE NAC 1) significantly enhances drought resistance in transgenic rice (22–34% higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty.
 SNAC1 is induced predominantly in guard cells by drought and encodes a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor with transactivation activity.
 Our data suggest that SNAC1 holds promising utility in improving drought and salinity tolerance in rice.
Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae strain PXO99A induces the expression of the host gene Os8N3, which results in increased host susceptibility to bacterial blight of rice.
 Induction of OsTFX1 and OsTFIIA1 depended on the type III effector genes pthXo6 and pthXo7, respectively, both encoding two previously undescribed members of the transcription activator_like (TAL) effector family.
The loss of pthXo6 resulted in reduced pathogen virulence, and ectopic expression of OsTFX1 abrogated the requirement for pthXo6 for full virulence.
 oryzae therefore modulates the expression of multiple host genes using multiple TAL effectors from a single strain, and evidence supports the hypothesis that expression of the associated host genes contributes to host susceptibility to disease.
 Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM.
 In this study we showed that defects in SAM formation in shl mutants are associated with the loss of expression of the homeodomain leucine zipper (HD_ZIPIII) family genes.
 Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA_dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER_like 4, respectively,whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans_acting siRNA (ta_siRNA) pathway.
 This suggested that the ta_siRNA pathway regulates the critical step of SAM formation during rice embryogenesis.
 Analysis of the spatiotemporal expression patterns of HD_ZIPIII and miR166 in wild_type and shl mutant embryos suggested that the loss of HD_ZIPIII expression in the SAM region of the developing embryo is the result of ectopic expression of miR166.
 Our analysis of shl mutants demonstrated that HD_ZIPIII expression regulated by miR166 is sensitive to the ta_siRNA pathway during SAM formation in rice embryogenesis.
 To understand the downstream BR signaling mechanism in rice, we studied the function of OsBZR1 using reverse genetic approaches and identified OsBZR1_interacting proteins.
 Suppressing OsBZR1 expression by RNAi resulted in dwarfism, erect leaves, reduced BR sensitivity, and altered BR_responsive gene expression in transgenic rice plants, demonstrating an essential role of OsBZR1 in BR responses in rice.
 Mutation of a putative 14_3_3_binding site of OsBZR1 abolished its interaction with the 14_3_3 proteins in yeast and in vivo.
 Such mutant OsBZR1 proteins suppressed the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis bri1–5 mutant and showed an increased nuclear distribution compared with the wild_type protein, suggesting that 14_3_3 proteins directly inhibit OsBZR1 function at least in part by reducing its nuclear localization.
 These results demonstrate a conserved function of OsBZR1 and an important role of 14_3_3 proteins in brassinosteroid signal transduction in rice.
 IDEF1 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the plant_specific transcription factor family ABI3/VP1 and exhibits the sequence recognition property of efficiently binding to the CATGC sequence within IDE1.
 IDEF1 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves.
 Transgenic tobacco plants expressing IDEF1 under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter transactivate IDE1_mediated expression only in iron_deficient roots.
Transgenic rice plants expressing an introduced IDEF1 exhibit substantial tolerance to iron deficiency in both hydroponic culture and calcareous soil.
 IDEF1 overexpression leads to the enhanced expression of the iron deficiency_induced transcription factor gene OsIRO2,suggesting the presence of a sequential gene regulatory network.
 Manipulation of IDEF1 also provides another approach for producing crops tolerant of iron deficiency to enhance food and biomass production in calcareous soils.
 We have characterized RFL by knockdown of its expression and by its ectopic overexpression in transgenic rice.
 We find that reduction in RFL expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering, with the extreme phenotype being no flowering.
 Conversely, RFL overexpression triggers precocious flowering.
 In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering.
 Aside from facilitating a transition of the main growth axis to an inflorescence meristem, RFL expression status affects vegetative axillary meristems and therefore regulates tillering.
 The unique spatially and temporally regulated RFL expression during the development of vegetative axillary bud (tiller) primordia and inflorescence branch primordia is therefore required to produce tillers and panicle branches, respectively.
 Our data provide mechanistic insights into a unique role for RFL in determining the typical rice plant architecture by regulating distinct downstream pathways.
 These results offer a means to alter rice flowering time and plant architecture by manipulating RFL_mediated pathways.
Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation.
 In this study, we cloned S5, a major locus for indica japonica hybrid sterility and wide compatibility, using a map_based cloning approach.
 We show that S5 encodes an aspartic protease conditioning embryo_sac fertility.
 The indica (S5_i) and japonica (S5_j) alleles differ by two nucleotides.
 The wide compatibility gene (S5_n) has a large deletion in the N terminus of the predicted S5 protein, causing subcellular mislocalization of the protein, and thus is presumably nonfunctional.
 Genetic differentiation between indica and japonica would have been enforced because of the reproductive barrier caused by S5_i and S5_j, and species coherence would have been maintained by gene flow enabled by the wide compatibility gene.
 The QTL qLTG3–1 is strongly expressed in the embryo during seed germination.
 Before and during seed germination, specific localization of beta_glucuronidase staining in the tissues covering the embryo, which involved the epiblast covering the coleoptile and the aleurone layer of the seed coat, was observed.
 These phenomena are quite similar to the model system of seed germination presented by dicot plants, suggesting that this model may be conserved in both dicot and monocot plants.
 Loss_of_function mutations of the gene lead to increased di_ and trimethylations of H3K9 and affect the spikelet development, including altered floral morphology and organ number.
 RID1 encodes a Cys_2/His_2_type zinc finger transcription factor that does not have an ortholog in Arabidopsis spp.
 A RID1 knockout (rid1), mutated by T_DNA insertion,never headed after growing for >500 days under a range of growth conditions and is thus referred to as a never_flowering phenotype.
 RID1 seems to be independent of the circadian clock.
 A model was proposed to place RID1 in the molecular pathways of flowering regulation in rice, for which there are two indispensable elements.
 In the first, RID1 is controlling the phase transition and initiation of floral induction.
Sterility is common in hybrids between divergent populations,such as the indica and japonica subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa).
 Although multiple loci for plant hybrid sterility have been identified, it remains unknown how alleles of the loci interact at the molecular level.
 Here we show that a locus for indicajaponica hybrid male sterility, Sa, comprises two adjacent genes,SaM and SaF, encoding a small ubiquitin_like modifier E3 ligase_like protein and an F_box protein, respectively.
 Male semi_sterility in this heterozygous complex locus is caused by abortion of pollen carrying SaM.
 This allele_specific gamete elimination results from a selective interaction of SaF with SaM, a truncated protein, but not with SaM because of the presence of an inhibitory domain, although SaM is required for this male sterility.
 Lack of any one of the three alleles in recombinant plants does not produce male sterility.
 We propose a two_gene/threecomponent interaction model for this hybrid male sterility system.
The findings have implications for overcoming male sterility in inter_subspecific hybrid rice breeding.
 Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development.
 Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF2a and RF2b had essentially no impact on plant development.
 Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration.
Conflict/reconciliation between mitochondria and nuclei in plants is manifested by the fate of pollen (viable or nonviable) in the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)/fertility restoration (Rf) system.
 Through positional cloning, we identified a nuclear candidate gene, RETROGRADE_REGULATED MALE STERILITY (RMS) for Rf17, a fertility restorer gene for Chinese wild rice (CW)_type CMS in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 RNA interference_mediated gene silencing of RMS restored fertility to a CMS plant, whereas its overexpression in the fertility restorer line induced pollen abortion.
 We found that a reduced_expression allele of the RMS gene restored fertility in haploid pollen, whereas a normal_expression allele caused pollen to die in the CW_type CMS.
 Suppression of OsSKIPa in rice resulted in growth arrest and reduced cell viability.
 The expression OsSKIPa is induced by various abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments.
 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsSKIPa exhibited significantly improved growth performance in the medium containing stress agents (abscisic acid, salt, or mannitol) and drought resistance at both the seedling and reproductive stages.
 The OsSKIPa_overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species_scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress_related genes,including SNAC1 and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions.
Together, these data suggest that OsSKIPa has evolved a specific function in positive modulation of stress resistance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress_related genes in rice.
 Detailed phenotypic analysis reveals that the large sterile lemma in the g1 mutant appears to be caused by homeotic transformation of the sterile lemma into a lemma, suggesting that G1 is involved in the repression of lemma identity to specify the sterile lemma.
 Gene isolation reveals that G1 is a member of a plant_specific gene family that encodes proteins with a previously uncharacterized domain, named here ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1).
 G1 mRNA is expressed in sterile lemma primordia throughout their development, and G1 protein is localized in the nucleus.
 A trans_activation assay using the yeast GAL4 system suggests that G1 is involved in transcriptional regulation.
 Repression of lemma identity by G1 is consistent with a hypothesis proposed to explain the morphological evolution of rice spikelets.
We also show that a wild rice species, Oryza grandiglumis, that forms large sterile lemmas has serious mutations in the G1 gene.
Hybrid incompatibility in F1 hybrids or later generations is often observed as sterility or inviability.
 Here, we show that the reciprocal loss of duplicated genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 causes hybrid pollen sterility in F1 hybrids of the cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relative O.
 Functional analysis revealed that this gene is essential for the later stage of pollen development, and distribution analysis suggests that the gene duplication occurred before the divergence of the AA genome species.
 Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activationtagged plants (OsNAS3_D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn.
9_fold), Zn (2.
 Furthermore, this activation led to increased tolerance to Fe and Zn deficiencies and to excess metal (Zn, Cu, and Ni) toxicities.
 In contrast, disruption of OsNAS3 caused an opposite phenotype.
Seed dormancy provides a strategy for flowering plants to survive adverse natural conditions.
 It is also an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield, quality, and processing performance.
 We cloned a rice quantitative trait locus, Sdr4, which contributes substantially to differences in seed dormancy between japonica (Nipponbare) and indica (Kasalath) cultivars.
 Sdr4 expression is positively regulated by OsVP1, a global regulator of seed maturation, and in turn positively regulates potential regulators of seed dormancy and represses the expression of postgerminative genes,suggesting that Sdr4 acts as an intermediate regulator of dormancy in the seed maturation program.
 We show that Bph14 encodes a coiled_coil, nucleotide_binding, and leucine_rich repeat (CC_NB_LRR) protein.
 Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response.
 Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles,the site of BPH feeding.
 Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects.
 Osppc4 was expressed in all organs tested and showed high expression in theleaves.
 Its expression in the leaves was confined to mesophyll cells, and Osppc4 accounted for approximately one_third of total PEPC protein in theleaf blade.
 Knockdown of Osppc4 expression by the RNAi technique resulted in stunting at the vegetative stage, which was much more marked when rice plants were grown with ammonium than with nitrate as the nitrogen source.
 Comparison ofleafmetabolomes of ammonium_grown plants suggested that the knockdown suppressed ammonium assimilation and subsequent amino acid synthesis by reducing levels of organic acids, which are carbon skeleton donors for these processes.
 This suggests that, in addition to glycolysis,the genus Oryza has a unique route to provide organic acids for ammonium assimilation that involves a chloroplastic PEPC, and that this route is crucial for growth with ammonium.
 This work provides evidence for diversity of primary ammonium assimilation in the leaves of vascular plants.
 Independent disruptions of DPL1 and DPL2 occurred in indica and japonica, respectively.
 Pollen carrying two defective DPL alleles became nonfunctional and did not germinate, suggesting an essential role for DPLs in pollen germination.
 Comparative analyses suggested the geographic and phylogenetic distribution of these two defective alleles, showing that loss_of_function mutations of DPL1 genes emerged multiple times in indica and its wild ancestor, O.
 rufipogon, and that the DPL2 gene defect is specific to japonica cultivars.
 Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice.
 Nrat1 belongs to the Nramp (natural resistance_associated macrophage protein) family, but shares a low similarity with other Nramp members.
 When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al citrate complex.
 Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells.
 Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals.
 Expression of Nrat1 is up_regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1).
 We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane_localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles.
 Our results indicated that OsHMA3 from the low Cd_accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above_ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles.
 A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development.
 Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild_type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides,and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis.
 The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth.
 One of the two rice PsbS homologues (OsPsbS1) was found within the qNPQ1_2 region.
 PsbS protein was not accumulated in the leaf blade of the mutant harboring transferred DNA insertion in OsPsbS1.
 Here we report that an ATP_binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G (ABCG) full transporter is required for leaf water conservation in both wild barley and rice.
 To isolate a gene at Hd6, we used a large segregating population for the high_resolution and fine_scale mapping of Hd6 and constructed genomic clone contigs around the Hd6 region.
 Linkage analysis with P1_derived artificial chromosome clone_derived DNA markers delimited Hd6 to a 26.
However, it is unclear whether plant DNA demethylases can promote the transposition of transposons.
 Here we report the functional characterization of the DNA glycosylase/lyase DNG701 in rice.
 DNG701 encodes a large (1,812 amino acid residues) DNA glycosylase domain protein.
 Recombinant DNG701 protein showed 5_meC DNA glycosylase and lyase activities in vitro.
 Knockout or knockdown of DNG701 in rice plants led to DNA hypermethylation and reduced expression of the retrotransposon Tos17.
 Tos17 showed less transposition in calli derived from dng701 knockout mutant seeds compared with that in wild_type calli.
 Overexpression of DNG701 in both rice calli and transgenic plants substantially reduced DNA methylation levels of Tos17 and enhanced its expression.
 Our results demonstrate that rice DNG701 is a 5_meC DNA glycosylase/lyase responsible for the demethylation of Tos17 and this DNA demethylase plays a critical role in promoting Tos17 transposition in rice calli.
 OsLCT1_GFP was localized at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and OsLCT1 showed Cd efflux activity in yeast.
In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage.
 In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles.
 RNAi_mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem_mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem_mediated Cd transport.
 The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants.
 The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression.
 These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar,the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of “low_Cd rice”without negative effects on agronomical traits.
A rice spotted leaf (lesion_mimic) gene, Spl7, was identified by map_based cloning.
 In this paper, we report that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 that was required for many aspects of plant development can interact with dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2, a mark associated with moderately expressed or repressed genes) and with trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3, a mark associated with repressed genes), respectively, through the chromodomains and the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of the protein.
 Here, we demonstrate that a phytochrome_interacting factor_like protein, OsPIL1/OsPIL13, acts as a key regulator of reduced internode elongation in rice under drought conditions.
 The level of OsPIL1 mRNA in rice seedlings grown under nonstressed conditions with light/dark cycles oscillated in a circadian manner with peaks in the middle of the light period.
 Under drought stress conditions, OsPIL1 expression was inhibited during the light period.
We found that OsPIL1 was highly expressed in the node portions of the stem using promoter_glucuronidase analysis.
 Overexpression of OsPIL1 in transgenic rice plants promoted internode elongation.
 Alteration of internode cell size was observed in OsPIL1 transgenic plants, indicating that differences in cell size cause the change in internode length.
 Oligoarray analysis revealed OsPIL1 downstream genes, which were enriched for cell wall_related genes responsible for cell elongation.
 These data suggest that OsPIL1 functions as a key regulatory factor of reduced plant height via cell wall_related genes in response to drought stress.
 Making hybrid rice has proved to be an effective strategy to significantly increase grain yield.
 However, intrinsic problems exist in the implementation of these technologies, such as limited germplasms and unpredictable conversions from sterility to fertility in the field.
 Here, we describe a photoperiod_controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development.
 This mutation was introduced into indica and japonica rice, and it rendered male sterility under short_day conditions and male fertility under long_day conditions in both lines.
 Furthermore, F1 plants of csa and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice.
Flowering time (i.
e, heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments.
 Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long_day (LD) conditions.
 We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2), a minor_effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions.
 We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS_like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1.
Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia.
 Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor_effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.
 Despite their wide distribution and abundance, very few TEs have been found to be transpositional, indicating that TE activities may be tightly controlled by the host genome to minimize the potentially mutagenic effects associated with active transposition.
 Consistent with this notion, a growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic silencing pathways such as DNA methylation, RNA interference, and H3K9me2 function collectively to repress TE activity at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
 It is not yet clear, however, whether the removal of histone modifications associated with active transcription is also involved in TE silencing.
 Here, we show that the rice protein JMJ703 is an active H3K4_specific demethylase required for TEs silencing.
 Impaired JMJ703 activity led to elevated levels of H3K4me3, the misregulation of numerous endogenous genes, and the transpositional reactivation of two families of non_LTR retrotransposons.
 Interestingly,loss of JMJ703 did not affect TEs (such as Tos17) previously found to be silenced by other epigenetic pathways.
 These results indicate that the removal of active histone modifications is involved in TE silencing and that different subsets of TEs may be regulated by distinct epigenetic pathways.
Grain size and shape are important components determining rice grain yield, and they are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a major grain length QTL, qGL3, which encodes a putative protein phosphatase with Kelch_like repeat domain (OsPPKL1).
 We found a rare allele qgl3 that leads to a long grain phenotype by an aspartate_to_glutamate transition in a conserved AVLDT motif of the second Kelch domain in OsPPKL1.
 The rice genome has other two OsPPKL1 homologs, OsPPKL2 and OsPPKL3.
 Transgenic studies showed that OsPPKL1 and OsPPKL3 function as negative regulators of grain length, whereas OsPPKL2 as a positive regulator.
Field trials showed that the application of the qgl3 allele could significantly increase grain yield in both inbred and hybrid rice varieties, due to its favorable effect on grain length, filling,and weight.
 The rice (Oryza sativa L,Gn1a/OsCKX2 (Grain number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain number improvement in rice breeding practice.
 DST_directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs.
 We identify that DSTreg1,a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST_directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number.
 Our study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity, DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain production in rice and other small grain cereals.
 Map_based cloning revealed that SPIKE was identical to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), which has been reported to control vein pattern in leaf.
 Phenotypic analyses of a near_isogenic line of a popular indica cultivar, IR64, and overexpressor lines revealed increases in spikelet number, leaf size, root system, and the number of vascular bundles, indicating the enhancement of source size and translocation capacity as well as sink size.
 A dwa1 KO mutant was highly sensitive to drought stress relative to the WT.
 DWA1 was preferentially expressed in vascular tissues and epidermal layers and strongly induced by drought stress.
 The dwa1 mutant was impaired in cuticular wax accumulation under drought stress, which significantly altered the cuticular wax composition of the plant, resulting in increased drought sensitivity.
 The mutant had reduced levels of very_long_chain fatty acids, and plants overexpressing DWA1 showed elevated levels of very_long_chain fatty acids relative to the WT.
 The expression of many wax_related genes was significantly suppressed in dwa1 under drought conditions.
 Our results suggest that DWA1 controls drought resistance by regulating drought_induced cuticular wax deposition in rice.
 The host regulates the activity of different TEs by different epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone H3K9 methylation, and histone H3K4 demethylation.
 Here, we show that the rice Dicer_like 3 homolog OsDCL3a is primarily responsible for 24_nt siRNA processing.
 Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches.
 Reduction of OsDCL3a function reduced the 24_nt siRNAs predominantly from MITEs and elevated expression of nearby genes.
 OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle.
It has long been established that premature leaf senescence negatively impacts the yield stability of rice, but the underlying molecular mechanism driving this relationship remains largely unknown.
 PS1 encodes a plantspecific NAC (no apical meristem, Arabidopsis ATAF1/2, and cupshaped cotyledon2) transcriptional activator, Oryza sativa NAC_like, activated by apetala3/pistillata (OsNAP).
 Overexpression of OsNAP significantly promoted senescence, whereas knockdown of OsNAP produced a marked delay of senescence, confirming the role of this gene in the development of rice senescence.
 OsNAP expression was tightly linked with the onset of leaf senescence in an age_dependent manner.
 Similarly, ChIP_PCR and yeast onehybrid assays demonstrated that OsNAP positively regulates leaf senescence by directly targeting genes related to chlorophyll degradation and nutrient transport and other genes associated with senescence, suggesting that OsNAP is an ideal marker of senescence onset in rice.
 Further analysis determined that OsNAP is induced specifically by abscisic acid (ABA), whereas its expression is repressed in both aba1 and aba2, two ABA biosynthetic mutants.
Moreover, ABA content is reduced significantly in ps1_D mutants,indicating a feedback repression of OsNAP on ABA biosynthesis.
Our data suggest that OsNAP serves as an important link between ABA and leaf senescence.
 Additionally, reduced OsNAP expression leads to delayed leaf senescence and an extended grain_filling period, resulting in a 6.
3% increase in the grain yield of two independent representative RNAi lines, respectively.
 Thus,fine_tuning OsNAP expression should be a useful strategy for improving rice yield in the future.
 AtPHR1 and OsPHR2 expression is not very responsive to Pi starvation, raising the question as to how plants sense changes in cellular Pi levels to activate the central regulator.
 Here, we show that the nuclear localized SPX proteins SPX1 and SPX2 are Pi_dependent inhibitors of the activity of OsPHR2 in rice.
 We found that seeds homozygous for OsMet1_2 gene mutation (OsMET1_2−/−), which directly segregated from normal heterozygote plants (OsMET1_2+/−),were seriously maldeveloped, and all germinated seedlings underwent swift necrotic death.
Tiller angle, a key agronomic trait for achieving ideal plant architecture and increasing grain yield, is regulated mainly by shoot gravitropism.
 Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that are essential for shoot branching/rice tillering and have further biological functions as yet undetermined.
 Through screening for suppressors of lazy1 (sols), a classic rice mutant exhibiting large tiller angle and defective shoot gravitropism, we identified multiple SOLS that are involved in the SL biosynthetic or signaling pathway.
 We show that SL biosynthetic or signaling mutants can rescue the spreading phenotype of lazy1 (la1) and that SLs can inhibit auxin biosynthesis and attenuate rice shoot gravitropism, mainly by decreasing the local indoleacetic acid content.
 Although both SLs and LA1 are negative regulators of polar auxin transport, SLs do not alter the lateral auxin transport of shoot base, unlike LA1, which is a positive regulator of lateral auxin transport in rice.
 Genetic evidence demonstrates that SLs and LA1 participate in regulating shoot gravitropism and tiller angle in distinct genetic pathways.
 Our results disclose a new role of SLs and shed light on a previously unidentified mechanism underlying shoot gravitropism.
 Molecular and linkage analysis maps the OsGA3ox1 gene to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5; the OsGA3ox2 gene maps to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1 that corresponds to the D18 locus.
 The association of the OsGA3ox2 gene with the d18 locus is confirmed by sequence and complementation analysis of three d18 alleles.
 We found that OsABCC1 was expressed in many organs, including the roots, leaves, nodes, peduncle, and rachis.
 In both the basal nodes and upper nodes, which are connected to the panicle, OsABCC1 was localized to the phloem region of vascular bundles.
 Furthermore, OsABCC1 was localized to the tonoplast and conferred phytochelatin_dependent As resistance in yeast.
 Knockout of OsABCC1 in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to As, but did not affect cadmium toxicity.
 At the reproductive growth stage, the As content was higher in the nodes and in other tissues of wild_type rice than in those of OsABCC1 knockout mutants, but was significantly lower in the grain.
 Taken together, our results indicate that OsABCC1 limits As transport to the grains by sequestering As in the vacuoles of the phloem companion cells of the nodes in rice.
 d1 mutants exhibited a highly reduced hypersensitive response to infection by an avirulent race of rice blast.
 H2O2 production and PR gene expression induced by sphingolipid elicitors (SE) were strongly suppressed in d1 cell cultures.
 Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE_dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast.
 We have proposed a model for the defense signaling of rice in which the heterotrimeric G protein functions upstream of the small GTPase OsRac1 in the early steps of signaling.
 We identified the LAX PANICLE (LAX) and SMALL PANICLE (SPA) genes as the main regulators of axillary meristem formation in rice.
 LAX encodes a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor and is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and the region of new meristem formation.
 This pattern of LAX expression was repeatedly observed in every axillary meristem, consistent with our observation that LAX is involved in the formation of all types of axillary meristems throughout the ontogeny of a rice plant.
 Ectopic LAX expression in rice caused pleiotropic effects, including dwarfing, an altered pattern of stem elongation, darker color, bending of the lamina joint, absence of the midribs of leaves, and severe sterility.
During postembryonic development of higher plants, the shoot apical meristem produces lateral organs in a regular spacing (phyllotaxy) and a regular timing (plastochron).
 Molecular analysis of mutants associated with phyllotaxy and plastochron would greatly increase understanding of the developmental mechanism of plant architecture because phyllotaxy and plastochron are fundamental regulators of plant architecture.
 pla1 of rice is not only a plastochron mutant showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting phyllotaxy, but also a heterochronic mutant showing ectopic shoot formation in the reproductive phase.
 Thus, pla1 provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of temporal regulation in leaf development.
 In this work, we isolated the PLA1 gene by map_based cloning.
 The identified PLA1 gene encodes a cytochrome P450, CYP78A11, which potentially catalyzes substances controlling plant development.
 PLA1 is expressed in developing leaf primordia, bracts of the panicle, and elongating internodes, but not in the shoot apical meristem.
 The expression pattern and mutant phenotype suggest that the PLA1 gene acting in developing leaf primordia affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of vegetative growth.
 Linkage analysis revealed that a cDNA encoding the a_subunit of GTP_binding protein cosegregated with d1 in 3,185 d1 segregants.
 Southern hybridization analysis with this cDNA as a probe showed different band patterns in several d1 mutant lines.
 In at least four independent d1 mutants, no gene transcript was observed by Northern hybridization analysis.
A transgenic d1 mutant with GTP_binding protein gene restored the normal phenotype.
Because the d1 mutant is classified as gibberellin_insensitive,we suggest that the GTP_binding protein might be associated with gibberellin signal transduction.
Production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and a form of programmed cell death called hypersensitive response (HR) are often associated with disease resistance of plants.
 Here we show that the constitutively active OsRac1 (i) causes HR_like responses and greatly reduces disease lesions against a virulent race of the rice blast fungus; (ii) causes resistance against a virulent race of bacterial blight; and (iii) causes enhanced production of a phytoalexin and alters expression of defense_related genes.
 The dominant_negative OsRac1 suppresses elicitor_induced ROI production in transgenic cell cultures, and in plants suppresses the HR induced by the avirulent race of the fungus.
 Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that OsRac1 has a general role in disease resistance of rice.
 Expression of OsYSL15 in root epidermis and stele was induced by iron deficiency and showed daily fluctuation.
 OsYSL15 restored a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when supplied with iron(III)_deoxymugineic acid and transported iron(III)_deoxymugineic acid in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
 OsYSL15 promoter_ _glucuronidase analysis revealed that OsYSL15 expression in roots was dominant in the epidermis/exodermis and phloem cells under conditions of iron deficiency and was detected only in phloem under iron sufficiency.
 These results strongly suggest that OsYS 15 is the dominant iron(III)_deoxymugineic acid transporter responsible for iron uptake from the rhizosphere and is also responsible for phloem transport of iron.
 OsYSL15 was also expressed in flowers, developing seeds, and in the embryonic scutellar epithelial cells during seed germination.
 OsYSL15 knockdown seedlings showed severe arrest in germination and early growth and were rescued by high iron supply.
 These results demonstrate that rice OsYSL15 plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis during the early stages of growth.
 The aim of this research was to resolve uncertainty about the localization of RCA, and to determine whether the distributions of Rubisco and RCA were altered when RCA content was reduced.
  Methods Gas exchange and Rubisco were measured, and the sub_cellular locations of Rubisco and RCA were determined using immunogold_labelling electron microscopy, in wild_type and antisense rca rice plants.
  Key Results In antisense rca plants, net photosynthetic rate and the initial Rubisco activity decreased much less than RCA content.
 However, the amount of Rubisco in the antisense rca plants was greater than in the wild_type plants.
 RCA was detected in both the chloroplast stroma and in the thylakoid membranes of wild_type plants.
 The percentage of RCA labelling in the thylakoid membrane was shown to be substantially decreased, while the fraction in the stroma was increased, by the antisense rca treatment.
  Conclusions From the changes in RCA distribution and alterations in Rubisco activity, RCA in the stroma of the chloroplast probably contributes to the activation of Rubisco, and RCA in thylakoids compensates for the reduction of RCA in the stroma, allowing steady_state photosynthesis to be maintained when RCA is depleted.
 RCA may also have a second role in protecting membranes against environmental stresses as a chaperone.
 † Methods Antisense and over_expression constructs of ARAG1 were introduced into rice by an Agrobacterium_mediated method.
 RT_PCR and western blot were used to detect ARAG1 accumulation in transgenics.
 †Key Results ARAG1 was expressed in inflorescences, roots, immature embryos and germinating seeds, but not in coleoptiles, leaves or mature embryos.
 ARAG1 knockdown line was hypersensitive to ABA application during seed germination and seedling growth.
 However, the line over_expressing ARAG1 behaved similarly to wild type in these circumstances.
 Knockdown of ARAG1 weakened tolerance of the transgenic seedlings to drought stress, while over_expression of it increased the tolerance slightly.
 †Conclusions These results indicate that ARAG1 was involved in the ABA signalling and stress responsive pathways.
 The expression of OsiICK6 in different tissues and in response to several treatments was analysed by reverse transcriptase_mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT_PCR) and real_time PCR.
 Furthermore, OsiICK6 was over_expressed in transgenic rice plants and significant phenotypes were observed.
 †Key Results and Conclusions Based on putative protein sequences, the six OsiICKs are grouped into two classes, with OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 in each of the two classes, respectively.
 Results showed that OsiICK1 and OsiICK6 interacted with OsCYCD, but differed in their interactions with CDKA.
 It has previously been shown that ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (ADH1) is required for cell division and cell elongation in the coleoptile of submerged rice seedlings by means of studies using a rice ADH1_deficient mutant, reduced adh activity (rad).
 The aim of this study was to understand how low ADH1 in rice affects carbohydrate metabolism in the embryo and endosperm, and lactate and alanine synthesis in the embryo during germination and subsequent coleoptile growth in submerged seedlings.
 † Methods Wild_type and rad mutant rice seeds were germinated and grown under complete submergence.
 †Key resultsIn the rad embryo, the rate of ethanol fermentation was halved, while lactate and alanine concentrations were 2.
 The radmutant endosperm had loweramounts of the α_amylases RAMY1A and RAMY3D, resulting in less starch degradation and lower glucose concentrations.
 †Conclusions These results suggest that ADH1 is essential for sugar metabolism via glycolysis to ethanol fermentation in both the embryo and endosperm.
 Two homozygous lines, HW1 and HW5, of OASA1D transgenic rice were generated for characterization of agronomic traits and aromatic metabolite profiling of seeds.
 The marked overproduction of Trp was stable in these lines under field conditions, although spikelet fertility and yield, as well as seed germination ability, were reduced compared with the wild type.
 The establishment and characterization of these OASA1D transgenic lines have thus demonstrated the feasibility of increasing the Trp content in the seeds of rice (or of other crops) as a means of improving its nutritional value for human consumption or animal feed.
 Therefore, the role of the C_terminal extension in functional expression of OsGAD2 was investigated.
 An in vitro enzyme assay using recombinant OsGAD2 proteins revealed low activity in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM.
 Calli overexpressing OsGAD2 and OsGAD2DC had about 6_fold and 100_fold the GABA content of wild_type calli, respectively.
 Regenerated OsGAD2DC rice plants had aberrant phenotypes such as dwarfism, etiolated leaves, and sterility.
 These data suggest that the C_terminal extension of OsGAD2 plays a role as a strong autoinhibitory domain, and that truncation of this domain causes the enzyme to act constitutively, with higher activity both in vitro and in vivo.
 Although the mechanisms of Zn translocation in rice plants (Oryza sativa) are not fully understood, it has recently received increased interest.
 OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsZIP4 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced.
 The Zn concentration in roots of 35S_OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots.
 The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S_OsZIP4 plants was four times lower compared with vector controls.
 Northern blot analysis and quantitative real_time reverse transcription_PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S_OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls.
 These results indicate that constitutive expression of OsZIP4 changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that OsZIP4 is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated.
 The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild_type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions.
 Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots.
 These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice.
Photorespiration is one of the most intensively studied topics in plant biology.
 The GLO_suppressed plants showed typical photorespiration_deficient phenotypes.
 The OsRAN2 gene, which has high homology (77% at the amino acid level) with its human counterpart, was isolated here.
 Subcellular localization results showed that OsRan2 is mainly localized in the nucleus, with some in the cytoplasm.
 Transcription of OsRAN2 was reduced by salt, osmotic, and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, as determined by real_time PCR.
 Overexpression of OsRAN2 in rice resulted in enhanced sensitivity to salinity, osmotic stress, and ABA.
 Seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing OsRAN2 were overly sensitive to salinity stress and exogenous ABA treatment.
 OsRAN2 overexpression in tobacco epidermal leaf cells disturbed the nuclear import of a maize (Zea mays L, leaf colour transcription factor (Lc).
 Through microarray analysis, a salt_responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings.
 ZFP179 encodes a 17.
 The real_time RT_PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments.
 Overexpression of ZFP179 in rice increased salt tolerance and the transgenic seedlings showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA.
 The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)_scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress_related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress.
 Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress.
Interaction and cross_talk between microtubules and actin microfilaments are important for numerous processes during plant growth and development, including the control of cell elongation and tissue expansion, but little is known about the molecular components of this interaction.
 The putative biological role of the rice KCH member OsKCH1 is addressed here using a combined approach with Tos17 kch1 knock_out mutants on the one hand, and a KCH1 overexpression line generated in tobacco BY_2 cells.
 It is shown that OsKCH1 is expressed in a development and tissue_specific manner in rice and antagonistic cell elongation and division phenotypes as a result of knock_down and overexpression are reported.
The brittle culm (bc) mutants of Gramineae plants having brittle skeletal structures are valuable materials for studying secondary cell walls.
 In contrast to other recessive bc mutants, rice Bc6 is a semi_dominant bc mutant with easily breakable plant bodies.
 In this study, the Bc6 gene was cloned by positional cloning.
 Bc6 encodes a cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, OsCesA9, and has a missense mutation in its highly conserved region.
 In culms of the Bc6 mutant, the proportion of cellulose was reduced by 38%, while that of hemicellulose was increased by 34%.
 Introduction of the semi_dominant Bc6 mutant gene into wild_type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes.
 Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that Bc6 mutation reduced the cell wall thickness of sclerenchymal cells in culms.
 In rice expressing a reporter construct, BC6 promoter activity was detected in the culms, nodes, and flowers, and was localized primarily in xylem tissues.
 This expression pattern was highly similar to that of BC1, which encodes a COBRA_like protein involved in cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls in rice.
 These results indicate that BC6 is a secondary cell wall_specific CesA that plays an important role in proper deposition of cellulose in the secondary cell walls.
 To elucidate the distinct and overlapping functions of these enzymes, double mutants were created by crossing the ss1 null mutant with the ss3a null mutant.
 Phenotypic analyses revealed lower SS activity in the endosperm of these lines than in those of the parent mutant lines since these seeds had different copies of SSI and SSIIIa genes in a heterozygous state.
 The endosperm of the two types of opaque seeds contained the unique starch with modified fine structure, round_shaped starch granules, high amylose content, and specific physicochemical properties.
 The double_recessive homozygous mutant prepared from both ss1 and ss3a null mutants was considered sterile, while the mutant produced by the leaky ss1 mutant3ss3a null mutant cross was fertile.
 This present study strongly suggests that at least SSI or SSIIIa is required for starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm.
 The role of the iron transporter OsNRAMP1 in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here.
 OsWRKY45_1_overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY45_1_knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity.
 In contrast, OsWRKY45_2_overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and OsWRKY45_2_suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance.
 In this study, reversed genetics was used to identify OsGMST1 as a member of the monosaccharide transporter family in rice.
 The predicted 481 amino acid protein has the typical features of a sugar transporter in the plastid glucose transporter subfamily consistent with reduced monosaccharide accumulation in plants with reduced OsGMST1 expression.
 OsGMST1 expression is induced by salt treatment and reduced expression confers hypersensitivity to salt stress in rice.
 OsGMST1 may play a direct or an indirect role in tolerance to salt stress in rice.
The rice somaclonal mutant T3612 produces small grains with a floury endosperm, caused by the loose packing of starch granules.
 Its absence is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in the endosperm, which is likely to underlie the formation of the floury endosperm in the T3612 mutant.
 In this study, knockout rice plants (Oryza sativa) tagged with the gene trap vector pGA2707 were screened for Cd tolerance, and the tolerant line lcd was obtained.
 The lcd mutant showed tolerance to Cd on agar plates and in hydroponic culture during early plant development.
 Metal concentration measurements in hydroponically grown plants revealed significantly less Cd in the shoots of lcd plants compared with wild_type (WT) shoots.
 When cultured in the field in soil artificially contaminated with low levels of Cd, lcd showed no significant difference in the Cd content of its leaf blades; however, the Cd concentration in the grains was 55% lower in 2009 and 43% lower in 2010.
 There were no significant differences in plant dry weight or seed yield between lcd and wild_type plants.
 LCD localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and was expressed mainly in the vascular tissues in the roots and phloem companion cells in the leaves.
 These data indicate that lcd may be useful for understanding Cd transport mechanisms and is a promising candidate rice line for use in combating the threat of Cd to human health.
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that positively regulates seed dormancy and stress tolerance.
 Transgenic rice plants expressing OsPYL/RCAR5, a PYL/RCAR orthologue of rice, were found to be hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth.
 Thus, a core signalling unit for ABA_responsive gene expression modulating seed germination and early seedling growth in rice has been unravelled.
 Expression of OsMYB2 was up_regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
 OsMYB2 was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity.
 Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up_regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters.
 These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress_responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
 Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice.
 Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C_KO line restored fertility.
 Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C_KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs).
 These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells.
 This study isolated a gene (OsFbx352) from rice encoding an F_box domain protein and characterized its role in seed germination.
 Expression of OsFbx352 was upregulated by abscisic acid (ABA).
 The transcripts of OsFbx352 were increased upon imbibition of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by glucose.
 Germination of seeds with overexpression of OsFbx352 was less suppressed by glucose than that of wild_type seeds, while glucose had greater inhibition for germination of seeds with knockdown of OsFbx352 by RNA interference (RNAi) than that of wild_type seeds.
 The differential response of germination of the transgenic and wild_type seeds to glucose may be accounted for by differences in ABA content among overexpressing, RNAi, and wild_type seeds such that overexpression of OsFbx352 and knockdown of OsFbx352 led to lower and higher ABA contents, respectively, than that of wild_type seeds in the presence of glucose.
 Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba_ox2, OsAba_ox3) in the presence of glucose.
 These findings indicate that OsFbx352 plays a regulatory role in the regulation of glucose_induced suppression of seed germination by targeting ABA metabolism.
In rice (Oryza sativa L,, leaf photosynthesis is known to be highly correlated with stomatal conductance; however, it remains unclear whether stomatal conductance dominantly limits the photosynthetic rate.
 SLAC1 is a stomatal anion channel protein controlling stomatal closure in response to environmental [CO2].
 A TILLING screen of N_methyl_N_nitrosourea_derived mutant lines was conducted for the rice SLAC1 orthologue gene Os04g0674700, and four mutant lines containing mutations within the open reading frame were obtained.
 Measurement of leaf gas exchange showed that slac1 plants grown in the greenhouse had significantly higher stomatal conductance (gs), rates of photosynthesis (A), and ratios of internal [CO2] to ambient [CO2] (Ci/Ca) compared with wild_type plants, whereas there was no significant difference in the response of photosynthesis to internal [CO2] (A/Ci curves).
 These observations demonstrate that in well_watered conditions, stomatal conductance is a major determinant of photosynthetic rate in rice.
 This report describes the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice.
 Subcellular localization revealed the cytosol–nuclear localization of both OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in onion epidermal cells.
 Both genes were also important for seed development, as their knock_down lines were associated with significant seed abortion.
 The thermotolerance assay revealed that OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 are negative regulators of HSR and involved in acquired thermotolerance but not in basal thermotolerance since their over_expression transgenic lines pre_heated at sublethal temperature, showed significantly decreased seedling survival after heat shock treatment.
 Furthermore, antioxidant activity and gene expression of catalase and peroxidase was significantly increased in knock_down transgenic seedlings of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 after heat stress compared with the wild type.
 Overall, the present study reveals the role of OsHSBP1 and OsHSBP2 in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice.
 Expression of OsGH3_2 was induced by drought but was suppressed by cold.
 Overexpression of OsGH3_2 in rice caused significant morphological aberrations related to IAA deficiency, such as dwarfism, smaller leaves, and fewer crown roots and root hairs.
 However, the overexpressing line showed increased cold tolerance, which was due to the combined effects of reduced free IAA content, alleviated oxidative damage, and decreased membrane penetrability.
 It was conclude that OsGH3_2 modulates both endogenous free IAA and ABA homeostasis and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.
 Stomatal aperture controls CO2 uptake and water loss to the atmosphere, thus playing important roles in both the yield gain and drought tolerance of crops.
 Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress_responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response.
 SNAC1 could bind to the promoter of OsSRO1c and activate the expression of OsSRO1c.
 OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress.
 The loss_of_function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild_type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss.
 OsSRO1c interacted with various stress_related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c_interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance.
 The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H2O2 accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.
Rice seed storage proteins glutelin and α_globulin are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and deposited in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs).
 Here, the identification and characterization of a novel AP gene, OsAP65, which plays an indispensable role in pollen tube growth in rice, is reported.
 The T_DNA insertion line of OsAP65 caused severe segregation distortion.
 However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood.
 OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis.
 osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose.
 Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin.
 Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch_synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression.
 These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
1 resulted in decreased chlorophyll levels, growth inhibition in the presence of high concentrations of Mn, and decreased accumulation of Mn in shoots and roots.
 Substantial progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying tillering control and spikelet sterility.
 However, rice tillering is developmentally controlled, and how it is regulated coordinately with reproductive growth remains unclear.
 This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1).
 Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation.
 In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages.
 The seed_setting rate of this1was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening.
 Histological analyses showed that the mutation in this1 resulted in anisotropic cell expansion and cell division.
 Using a map_based cloning approach, This1 was found to encode a class III lipase.
 Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control.
 The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin.
 Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development.
 A  phylogenic analysis suggested that rice OsCTR2 is closely related to CTR1, and ectopic expression of CTR1p.
 Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor_like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild_type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants.
 Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe_deficient medium.
 Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe_sufficient and Fe_deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe conentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively.
 Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe_sufficient conditions.
 OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency_induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe_deficient conditions, respectively.
 Several Fe deficiency_responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up_ and downregulated in OsRMC_overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants.
 These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe_deficient conditions.
 The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid.
 Green fluorescent protein_fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells.
 OsWRKY76 showed sequence_specific DNA binding to the W_box element in vitro and exhibited W_box_mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells.
 Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M.
 oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress.
 Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non_transformed control plants.
 Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress_associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes.
 These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays important roles in the regulation of seed dormancy and adaptation to abiotic stresses.
 This work demonstrates that the cytosolic ABA receptor OsPYL/RCAR5 in O.
 The constitutive expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 in rice driven by the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter induced the expression of many stress_responsive genes even under normal growth conditions and resulted in improved drought and salt stress tolerance in rice.
 However, it slightly reduced plant height under paddy field conditions and severely reduced total seed yield.
 This suggests that, although exogenous expression of OsPYL/RCAR5 is able to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice, fine regulation of its expression will be required to avoid deleterious effects on agricultural traits.
 Previous studies have revealed that the miR164 family in Arabidopsis is comprised of three members which guide the cleavage of the mRNAs of five NAC genes to modulate developmental processes.
 However, the functions of the miR164_targeted NAC genes in crops are poorly deciphered.
 In this study, the conserved features of six miR164_targeted NAC genes (OMTN1–OMTN6) in rice are described, and evidence is provided that four of them confer a negative regulatory role in drought resistance.
 OMTN proteins have the characteristics of typical NAC transcriptional factors.
 Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage.
 The results suggest that the conserved miR164_targeted NAC genes may be negative regulators of drought tolerance in rice, in addition to their reported roles in development.
 The mutant exhibited cleistogamy, and had closed spikelets, reduced plant height, and altered morphology of the leaves, panicle, and seeds.
 Anatomical investigations revealed that the cl7(t) mutant contained more vascular bundles and thicker stems than the wild type, which increased the mechanical strength of its internodes, and anti_lodging ability.
 Further studies demonstrated that the force required to open the lemma and palea was higher in the cl7(t) mutant, and there was weak swelling ability in the lodicules, which leads to cleistogamy.
 Allelic analyses and complementation tests indicated that cl7(t) was a novel allele of dep2, a mutant that was previously reported to have similar panicle morphology.
 Sequence analysis showed that cl7(t) had a single nucleotide substitution (C to A) in the third exon that leads to a Ser substitution with a stop codon, giving a truncated DEP2 protein.
 Quantitative RT_PCR and in situ hybridization tests demonstrated that there was lower CL7(t) expression level in the spikelets and weaker CL7(t) signals in the lodicules of the cl7(t) mutant compared with wild type, which implies that CL7(t) might participate in the development of lodicules.
 To improve the agronomic traits of cl7(t) to fit the needs of field production, the cl7(t) mutant was crossed with an intermediate_type rice variety named Guanghui102, which bears some important agronomic traits, including increased grain numbers and high rate of seed setting.
 A dominant negative form of OsNMD3 with a truncated nuclear localization sequence (OsNMD3ΔNLS) was retained in the cytoplasm, consequently interfering with the release of OsNMD3 from pre_60S particles and disturbing the assembly of ribosome subunits.
 Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsNMD3 is important for ribosome assembly and the maintenance of normal protein synthesis efficiency.
 OsXXT1 displays more than 70% amino acid sequence identity with the previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 1 (AtXXT1) and XYG XYLOSYL TRANSFERASE 2 (AtXXT2), which catalyse the transfer of xylose onto β_1,4_glucan chains.
 Furthermore, expression of the full_length coding sequence of OsXXT1 could complement the root hair defect, and slow growth and XyG synthesis in the Arabidopsis xxt1 xxt2 double mutant.
 Transgenic plants expressing the β_glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under the control of the OsXXT1 promoter displayed GUS expression in multiple tissues, most prominently in root epidermal cells.
 These results demonstrate the importance of OsXXT1 in maintaining cell wall structure and tensile strength in rice, a typical grass species that contains relatively low XyG content in cell walls.
 Substitution of the chromosome segment containing Nrat1 from Koshihikari (Al_tolerant variety) by that from Kasalath (Al_sensitive variety) decreased Nrat1 expression and Al uptake and tolerance, but increased binding of Al to the cell wall.
 Nrat1 in Kasalath showed tissue localization similar to Koshihikari in the roots.
 Although Koshihikari and Kasalath differed in four amino acids in Nrat1 protein, Nrat1 from Kasalath also showed transport activity for Al.
 On the other hand, there was good correlation between Nrat1 expression and Al tolerance; however, sequence comparison of the promoter region up to 2.
 Taken together, these results indicate that differential expression of Nrat1 is responsible for the QTL for Al tolerance on chromosome 2, although the mechanism controlling Nrat1 expression remains to be examined.
 In this study, we found that overexpression of OsPIN2, an auxin transporter gene, could alleviate Al_induced cell rigidity in rice root apices.
 A freeze–thawing experiment showed that the Al_treated roots of wild_type (WT) plants had more damage in the epidermal and outer cortex cells than that found in lines overexpressing OsPIN2 (OXs), and the freeze_disrupt coefficient was 2_fold higher in the former than in the latter.
 Overexpressed OsPIN2 reduced Al_induced formation of reactive oxygen species and weakened Al_induced lipid peroxidation and lignification in roots.
 Furthermore, overexpression of OsPIN2 ameliorated the Al inhibitory effect on basipetal auxin transport and increased Al_induced IAA and proton release.
 By modulating PIN2_based auxin transport, IAA efflux, and cell wall acidification, lines overexpressing OsPIN2 alleviate Al_induced cell rigidity in the rice root apex.
The rice Xa21 gene, which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo), encodes a receptor_like kinase.
 Here, we report that XA21 binds to a WRKY transcription factor, called OsWRKY62.
 The OsWRKY62 gene encodes two splice variants (OsWRKY62.
Pollen fertility is a crucial factor for successful pollination and essential for seed formation.
 Recent studies have suggested that a diverse range of internal and external factors, signaling components and their related pathways are likely involved in pollen fertility.
 OsPBP1 is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but down_regulated by pollination.
 OsPBP1 had a calcium concentration_dependent phospholipid_binding activity and was localized mainly in cytoplasm and nucleus, but translocated onto the plasma membrane in response to an intracellular Ca21 increase.
 Pollen grains of antisense OsPBP1 transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility.
 OsPBP1 protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination.
 Taken together, these results indicate that OsPBP1 is a novel functional C2_domain phospholipids_binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca21 and phospholipid signaling pathways.
 The T_DNA was inserted in the promoter of a novel gene, ACL1 (Abaxially Curled Leaf 1), and led to overexpression of this gene in BY240.
 Overexpression of ACL1 in wild_type rice also resulted in abaxial leaf curling.
 ACL1 encodes a protein of 116 amino acids with no known conserved functional domains.
 Overexpression of ACL2, the only homolog of ACL1 in rice, also induced abaxial leaf curling.
 RT–PCR analysis revealed high expressions of ACLs in leaf sheaths and leaf blades, suggesting a role for these genes in leaf development.
 These results revealed an important mechanism in rice leaf development and provided the genetic basis for agricultural improvement.
 SDG728 and other SUVH genes were found to be involved in the repression of retrotransposons such as Tos17 and a Ty1_copia element.
 The MAIF1 protein is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus.
 MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses.
 MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin.
 Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth.
 These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth.
 Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth.
 Crown roots are main components of the fibrous root system and important for crops to anchor and absorb water and nutrition.
 To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND1).
 The defect of visible crown root in the Oscand1 mutant is the result of cessation of the G2/M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem.
 Map_based cloning revealed that OsCAND1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis CAND1.
 During crown root primordium development, the expression of OsCAND1 is confined to the root cap after the establishment of fundamental organization.
Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height.
 Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20_kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT_box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate.
 A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background.
 By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long_day conditions, but promoted flowering under short_day conditions.
 Ghd8 up_regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant.
 The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d—a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild_type under long_day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis.
 Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long_day conditions.
 In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax_deficient mutant osgl1_1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax_deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype.
 We cloned the OsGL1_1 gene by the map_based cloning method and performed a complementation test to confirm the function of the candidate gene.
 Molecular studies revealed that OsGL1_1 was a member of the OsGL1 family, and contained regions that were homologous to some regions in sterol desaturases and short_chain dehydro genases/reductases.
 Compared to the wild_type, the osgl1_1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought.
 OsGL1_1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice.
 The transient expression of OsGL1_1–green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated that OsGL1_1 is localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus.
 Several members of the Aux/IAA family have been shown to play crucial roles in lateral root development.
 Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development.
 The gain_of_function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development.
 The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia.
 The auxin reporter DR5–GUS (b_glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild_type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps.
 The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant.
 Taken together, the results indicate that the gain_of_function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice.
 In order to identify new genes involved in root elongation in rice, we screened an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)_mutagenized rice library, and isolated a short root mutant, Osglu3_1.
 Osglu3_1 displayed less crystalline cellulose content in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, and a slightly smaller root meristem as visualized by restricted expression of OsCYCB1,1.
 RPL1 was expressed in all tissues examined.
 The rpl1 mutation led to an increase in DNA methylation on repetitive sequences and a decrease in overall histone acetylation.
 Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene.
 These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones.
 Although few mutants with altered leaf angles have been reported, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated, especially whether hormones are involved in this process.
 Phenotypic analysis confirmed the exaggerated leaf angles of lc1_D due to the stimulated cell elongation at the lamina joint.
 LC1 is transcribed in various tissues and encodes OsGH3_1, an indole_3_acetic acid (IAA) amido synthetase, whose homolog of Arabidopsis functions in maintaining the auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess IAA to various amino acids.
 Indeed, recombinant LC1 can catalyze the conjugation of IAA to Ala, Asp, and Asn in vitro, which is consistent with the decreased free IAA amount in lc1_D mutant.
 Treatments with ABA, H2O2, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsDMI3 and the activity of OsDMI3, and H2O2 is required for the ABA_induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 under water stress.
 Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsDMI3 is located in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the plasma membrane.
 The analysis of the transient expression of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts and the RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of OsDMI3 in rice protoplasts showed that OsDMI3 is required for ABA_induced increases in the expression and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).
 Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of OsDMI3 in protoplasts and the mutant of OsDMI3 showed that higher levels of H2O2 accumulation require OsDMI3 activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H2O2 production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of OsDMI3 in leaves of rice plants.
 Our data reveal that OsDMI3 is an important component in ABA_induced antioxidant defense in rice.
Photoperiod_sensitive male sterility (PSMS) is a valuable germplasm for hybrid rice breeding.
 Recently, we cloned pms3, a locus controlling PSMS, which encodes a long non_coding RNA called LDMAR required for normal male fertility of the rice plant under long_day conditions.
 Increased methylation in the promoter of LDMAR in the PSMS rice (Nongken 58S) relative to the wild_type (Nongken 58) reduced expression of LDMAR leading to male sterility under long_day conditions.
 Overexpressing AK111270 in Nongken 58S greatly enriched Psi–LDMAR, which induced RNA_directed DNA methylation in the LDMAR promoter and repressed the expression of LDMAR.
 Reduction of LDMAR in Nongken 58S changed the critical day length for fertility recovery and delayed the fertility recovery under short_day conditions.
MSH5, a meiosis_specific member of the MutS_homolog family, is required for normal level of recombination in budding yeast, mice, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis.
 Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, OsMSH5, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis.
 Five independent Osmsh5 mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility.
 OsMSH5 is predominantly expressed in panicles.
 Immunofluorescence studies indicate that OsMSH5 chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I.
 Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation.
 We found that the transposition activity of mPing is far higher in the lines harboring a non_functional allele at the Rurm1 (Rice ubiquitin_related modifier_1) locus than in the wild_type line.
 Although the alteration of cytosine methylation pattern triggers the activation of transposable elements under exogenous stress conditions, the methylation degrees in the whole genome, the mPing_body region, and the mPing_flanking regions of the non_functional Rurm1 line were unchanged.
 In this study, we report identification and characterization of ethylene_response mutants based on the specific ethylene_response phenotypes of etiolated rice seedlings, including ethylene_inhibited root growth and ethylene_promoted coleoptile elongation, which is different from the ethylene triple_response phenotype in Arabidopsis.
 All the mutants show insensitivity or reduced sensitivity to ethylene in root growth but exhibit differential responses in coleoptile growth.
 Upon ethylene treatment, etiolated MHZ7_overexpressing seedlings exhibit enhanced coleoptile elongation, increased mesocotyl growth and extremely twisted short roots, featuring enhanced ethylene_response phenotypes in rice.
 Grain length was promoted in MHZ7_transgenic plants and 1000_grain weight was reduced in mhz7 mutants.
Heading date and photoperiod sensitivity are fundamental traits that determine rice adaptation to a wide range of geographic environments.
 By quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and candidate gene analysis using whole_genome re_sequencing, we found that Oryza sativa Pseudo_Response Regulator37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) is responsible for the Early heading7_2 (EH7_2)/Heading date2 (Hd2) QTL which was identified from a cross of late_heading rice ‘Milyang23 (M23)’ and early_heading rice ‘H143’.
 Genetic analysis revealed that the effects of PRR37 and Ghd7 alleles on heading date are additive, and PRR37 down_regulates Hd3a expression to suppress flowering under long_day conditions.
 Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to morphological traits and chlorophyll content of rice leaves were detected at the stages of heading to maturity, and a major QTL (qLSCHL4) related to flag leaf shape and chlorophyll content was detected at both stages in recombinant inbred lines constructed using the indica rice cultivar 93_11 and the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare.
 Overexpression lines transformed with vector carrying LSCHL4 from Nipponbare and a near_isogenic line of 93_11 (NIL_9311) had significantly increased leaf chlorophyll content, enlarged flag leaf size, and improved panicle type.
The Purple leaf (Pl) locus of rice (Oryza sativa L, affects regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in various plant tissues.
 OSB1 appeared to be allelic to the previously isolated R homologue, Ra1, but showed a striking difference at the C_terminus because of a 2_bp deletion.
 Characterization of the corresponding genomic region revealed that the sequence identical to a 5'_portion of OSB2 existed ~10_kb downstream of the OSB1 coding region.
 OSB2 lacks a conserved C_terminal domain.
 Restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses using an F, population indicate that both genes co_segregate with the purple leaf phenotype.
 A transient complementation assay showed that theanthocyanin pathway is inducible by OSB1 or OSB2.
 There was no difference between antisense and wild_type plants in carbohydrate content and photosynthetic ability of the flag leaves in the vegetative growth stage, suggesting that OsSUT1 may not play an important role in carbon metabolism, at least in these materials.
Heading date 3a (Hd3a) has been detected as a heading date related quantitative trait locus in a cross between rice cultivars Nipponbare and Kasalath.
 A previous study revealed that the Kasalath allele of Hd3a promotes heading under short_day (SD) conditions.
 High_resolution linkage mapping located the Hd3a locus in a 20_kb genomic region.
 The transcript levels of Hd3a were increased under SD conditions.
 The rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) gene, a homolog of CONSTANS (CO), has been shown to promote heading under SD conditions.
 By expression analysis, we showed that the amount of Hd3a mRNA is up_regulated by Hd1 under SD conditions, suggesting that Hd3a promotes heading under the control of Hd1.
 These results indicate that Hd3a encodes a protein closely related to Arabidopsis FT and that the function and regulatory relationship with Hd1 and CO, respectively, of Hd3a and FT are conserved between rice (an SD plant) and Arabidopsis (a long_day plant).
 This OsCHLH gene encodes the largest subunit of the rice Mg_chelatase, a key enzyme in the chlorophyll branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway.
 We have identified two additional chlorina mutants that have a Tos17 insertion in the OsCHLH gene.
 GUS assays and RNA blot analysis showed that expression of the OsCHLH gene is light inducible, while TEM analysis revealed that the thylakoid membrane of the mutant chloroplasts is underdeveloped.
 The chlorophyll content was very low in the OschlH mutants.
 OsNHX1 has the ability to suppress Na+, Li+ and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and sensitivity to a high K+ concentration, a novel phenotype of the nhx1 mutants.
 Analysis using rice cells expressing a fusion protein of OsNHX1 and green fluorescent protein and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for OsNHX1 confirmed the localization of OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts.
 These results indicate that the OsNHX1 gene encodes a vacuolar (Na+, K+)/H+ antiporter.
 Treatment with high concentrations of NaCl and KCl increased the transcript levels of OsNHX1 in rice roots and shoots.
 In addition, overexpression of OsNHX1 improved the salt tolerance of transgenic rice cells and plants.
 These results suggest that OsNHX1 on the tonoplasts plays important roles in the compartmentation of Na+ and K+ highly accumulated in the cytoplasm into the vacuoles, and the amount of the antiporter is one of the most important factors determining salt tolerance in rice.
 From an agronomic viewpoint, upland rice is traditionally considered as showing drought avoidance.
 spp indica cv.
 spp japonica cv.
 Xiushui 63) to water deficit, we observed young leaf rolling and the remarkable decline of cumulative transpiration in the upland rice.
 The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in low_land rice.
 The up_regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance.
 The physiological significance of this RWC3 up_regulation was then explored with the over_expression of RWC3 in transgenic lowland rice (O.
 These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice.
 OsTPC1 rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1.
 To elucidate its physiological roles, we generated transgenic rice plants and cultured cells overexpressing OsTPC1 mRNA.
 Furthermore, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertional knockout mutant of OsTPC1 was isolated.
 OsTPC1_overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the OsTPC1_knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that OsTPC1 has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane.
 Growth of Ostpc1 seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants.
 These results suggest that OsTPC1 functions as a Ca2+_permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development.
Rice SPK is a calmodulin_like domain protein kinase specific to immature seeds and promotes the degradation of sucrose.
 Therefore, antisense SPK transformants showed a defective production of storage starch, but accumulated sucrose in watery seeds.
In this study, we analyzed five tillering dwarf mutants that exhibit reduction of plant stature and an increase in tiller numbers.
 The phenotypes of tillering dwarf mutants suggest that they play roles in the control of tiller bud dormancy to suppress bud activity.
 However, tillering dwarf mutants show the dependence of both node position and planting density on their growth, which implies that the functions of tillering dwarf genes are independent of the developmental and environmental control of bud activity.
 Map_based cloning of the D3 gene revealed that it encodes an F_box leucine_trich repeat (LRR) protein orthologous to Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9.
 We suggest that tillering dwarf mutants are suitable for the study of bud activity control in rice and believe that future molecular and genetic studies using them may enable significant progress in understanding the control of tillering and shoot branching.
We have cloned a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, OsGEN_L (OsGEN_like), from rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 OsGEN_L possesses two domains, the N_ and I_ regions, that are conserved in the RAD2/XPG nuclease family.
 Database searches and phylogenetic analyses revealed that OsGEN_L belongs to class 4 of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, and OsGEN_L homologs were found in animals and higher plants.
 To elucidate the function of OsGEN_L, we generated rice OsGEN_L_RNAi transgenic plants in which OsGEN_L expression was silenced.
 Most of the OsGEN_L_RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male_sterile.
 OsGEN_L_RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development.
 A OsGEN_L–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the OsGEN_L promoter was specifically active in the anthers.
 Furthermore, a recombinant OsGEN_L protein possessed flap endonuclease activity and both single_stranded and double_stranded DNA_binding activities.
 Our results suggest that OsGEN_L plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice.
 In the lines with suppressed expression of α_amylase I_1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, seed germination and seedling growth were markedly delayed in comparison with those in the wild_type plants.
 However, the growth retardation was overcome by supplementation of sugars.
 Based on these results, we concluded that α_amylase I_1 targets the chloroplasts through the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi system and plays a significant role in the starch degradation in rice leaves.
Auxin transport affects a variety of important growth and developmental processes in plants, including the regulation of shoot and root branching.
 Phylogenetic analysis of 32 members of the PIN family, taken from across different species, showed that in terms of evolutionary relationship, OsPIN1 is closer to the PIN1 family than to the PIN2 family.
 It is, therefore, renamed as OsPIN1 in this study.
 OsPIN1 was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1.
 Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the OsPIN1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N_1_naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin_transport inhibitor)_treated wild_type plants.
 Over_expression or suppression of the OsPIN1 expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio.
 Taken together, these data suggest that OsPIN1 plays an important role in auxin_dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering.
That plant dwarfism is caused by hormonal defects related to gibberellin and brassinosteroid has been well documented.
 Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal.
 Similarly, initiation and organogenesis of the leaf primordia at the shoot apical meristem and those of the lateral root primordia at the root elongation zone occurred normally.
 These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis.
 Positional cloning of DBS1 revealed that it encoded a NACK_type kinesin_like protein (OsNACK), homologous to the essential components of a mitogen_activated protein kinase cascade during plant cytokinesis.
 A BLAST search indicated that DBS1 was the only gene encoding the OsNACK_type protein in the rice genome, and the dbs1 mutant produced only small amounts of the translatable DBS1 mRNA.
 Thus, we conclude that the dbs1 mutation causes a severe defect in DBS1 function but does not completely shut it down.
 We discuss the leaky phenotype of dbs1 under the restricted functioning of OsNACK.
 The genes for DREB1 orthologs, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B from rice, are induced by cold stress, and overexpression of DREB1 or OsDREB1 induced strong expression of stress_responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, resulting in increased tolerance to high_salt and freezing stresses.
 These transgenic rice plants showed not only growth retardation under normal growth conditions but also improved tolerance to drought, high_salt and low_temperature stresses like the transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB1 or DREB1.
 We identified target stress_inducible genes of OsDREB1A in the transgenic rice using microarray and RNA gel blot analyses.
 OsPDK1 was identified as a gibberellin_up_regulated gene using a cDNA microarray.
 The full_length cDNA for OsPDK1 was 1498 bp and encoded a predicted polypeptide of 363 amino acids.
 OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined.
 Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 µM GA3 for 24 h.
 OsPDK1 expression was up_regulated by GA3, and there was little effect of other plant hormones.
 The β_glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath.
 These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development.
 Our studies revealed that OsCRY1 genes were mainly expressed in the green plant tissue, while OsCRY2 gene expression was high in the coleoptile, flower and callus.
 However, it was found that Oscry2 protein was negatively regulated by blue light.
 Moreover, the level of Oscry2 protein also decreased upon red light treatment, and this red light_dependent degradation was shown to be mediated by phytochrome B.
 Overexpression of OsCRY1 genes resulted in an increased responsiveness to blue light when measuring coleoptile growth inhibition.
 In addition, OsCRY2 antisense transgenic rice flowered later than WT under both long_day and short_day conditions, indicating that Oscry2 is involved in the promotion of flowering time in rice.
 Semi_quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) analyses confirmed that the RIP1 transcript was abundant at the late stages of pollen development.
 Transgenic plants carrying a T_DNA insertion in the RIP1 gene displayed the phenotype of segregation distortion of the mutated rip1 gene.
 Reciprocal crosses between Rip1/rip1 heterozygous plants and the wild type showed that the rip1 allele could not be transmitted through the male.
 Microscopic analysis demonstrated that development in the rip1 pollen was delayed, starting at the early vacuolated stage.
 These results indicate that RIP1 is necessary for pollen maturation and germination.
 Therefore, RIP1 is probably a nuclear protein that may form a functional complex with other proteins and carry out essential cellular and developmental roles during the late stage of pollen formation.
To elucidate the genetic mechanism that regulates meristem maintenance in monocots, here we have examined the function of the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) in Oryza sativa (rice).
 Mutations in FON2 cause enlargement of the floral meristem, resulting in an increase in the number of floral organs, although the vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal.
 Molecular cloning reveals that FON2 encodes a small secreted protein, containing a CLE domain, that is closely related to CLAVATA3 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
 FON2 transcripts are localized at the apical region in all meristems in the aerial parts of rice plants, showing an expression pattern similar to that of Arabidopsis CLV3.
 Constitutive expression of FON2 causes a reduction in the number of floral organs and flowers, suggesting that both the flower and inflorescence meristems are reduced in size.
 This action of FON2 requires the function of FON1, an ortholog of CLV1.
 Constitutive expression of FON2 also causes premature termination of the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis, a phenotype similar to that caused by constitutive expression of CLV3.
 In dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis and tobacco, MKPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and microtubule organization.
 We investigated their expression in response to wounding, and found that the expression of OsMKP1 is rapidly induced by wounding.
 In this study, we functionally characterized the involvement of OsMKP1 in wound responses.
 The deduced amino acid sequence of OsMKP1 shows strong similarity to Arabidopsis AtMKP1 and tobacco NtMKP1.
 Moreover, OsMKP1 bound calmodulin in a manner similar to NtMKP1.
 Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss_of_function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi_dwarf phenotype.
 Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi_dwarf phenotype of osmkp1.
 Activities of two stress_responsive MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, in osmkp1 were higher than those in the wild type both before and after wounding.
 These results suggest that OsMKP1 is involved in the negative regulation of rice wound responses.
 Overexpression of the CK_inducible type_A response regulator OsRR6 abolished shoot regeneration, suggesting that OsRR6 acts as a negative regulator of CK signaling.
 Transgenic lines overexpressing OsRR6 (OsRR6_ox) had dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root systems and panicles.
 Increased content of trans_zeatin_type CKs in OsRR6_ox lines indicates that homeostatic control of CK levels is regulated by OsRR6 signaling.
 Constitutive overexpression of OsPID caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism.
 Abnormalities observed in the plants that overexpress OsPID could be phenocopied by treatment with an inhibitor of active polar transport of auxin, indicating that OsPID could be involved in the control of polar auxin transport in rice.
 Analysis of OsPID mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot.
We identified the gene responsible for three allelic lazy1 mutations of Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L, by map_based cloning, complementation and RNA interference.
 Two lazy1 mutants were LAZY1 null.
 Confirming and advancing the previously reported results on lazy1 mutants, we found the following.
 (i) Gravitropism is impaired, but only partially, in lazy1 coleoptiles.
 (ii) Circumnutation, observed in dark_grown coleoptiles, is totally absent from lazy1 coleoptiles.
 (iii) Primary roots of lazy1 mutants show normal gravitropism and circumnutation.
 (iv) LAZY1 is expressed in a tissue_specific manner in gravity_sensitive shoot tissues (i.
 (v) The gravitropic response of lazy1 coleoptiles is kinetically separable from that absent from lazy1 coleoptiles.
 (vi) Gravity_induced lateral translocation of auxin, found in wild_type coleoptiles, does not occur in lazy1 coleoptiles.
 Based on the genetic and physiological evidence obtained, it is concluded that LAZY1 is specifically involved in shoot gravitropism and that LAZY1_dependent and _independent signaling pathways occur in coleoptiles.
The responses of chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange rate and Rubisco activation state to temperature were examined in transgenic rice plants with 130 and 35% of the wild_type (WT) Rubisco content by transformation with rbcS cDNA in sense and antisense orientations, respectively.
 Gross photosynthesis at Ci¼ 28 Pa per Rubisco content in the WT between 12 and 208C was close to that of the antisense lines where high Rubisco control is present.
 Thus, Rubisco activity most strongly limited photosynthesis at cool temperatures.
 These results indicated that a selective enhancement of Rubisco content can enhance photosynthesis at cool temperatures, but in the sense line with enhanced Rubisco content Pi regeneration limitation occurred.
 The activation state of Rubisco measured at each temperature decreased with increasing Rubisco content, and the slope of activation to Rubisco content was independent of temperature.
Causes of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants have been studied for two decades, and mitochondrial chimeric genes have been predicted to induce CMS.
 DCW11 mRNA was preferentially expressed in anthers, with the highest expression in mature pollen.
 As predicted by the N_terminal sequence, DCW11 signal peptide–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in mitochondria.
 Knockdown of DCW11 in wild_type rice by RNA interference caused a major loss of seed_set fertility, without visible defect in pollen development.
 Since this knockdown phenotype resembled that of CW_CMS, we concluded that the down_regulation of DCW11 is correlated with CW_CMS.
 This idea was supported by the up_regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines.
 Down_regulation of DCW11 and up_regulation of AOX1a were also observed in two other types of rice CMS.
 Our result indicates that DCW11 could play a role as a mitochondrial signal transduction mediator in pollen germination.
 Here, OsPIP2;7 was cloned and proved to be an aquaporin with high activity in Xenopus oocytes.
 OsPIP2;7 was localized mainly in mesophyll cells of leaves.
 Yeast cells overexpressing OsPIP2;7 showed a higher survival rate after freeze–thaw stress.
 Furthermore, OsPIP2;7 enhanced the transpiration rate and tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice.
 These results indicated that OsPIP2;7 was involved in rapid water transport and maintenance of the water balance in cells, and ultimately improves the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress.
 Hd3a and FT proteins have recently been proposed to act as fl origens in rice and Arabidopsis , respectively; however, the molecular mechanisms of their function remain to be determined.
 In this study, we identifi ed GF14c (a 14_3_3 protein) as an Hd3a_interacting protein in a yeast two_hybrid screen.
 In vitro and in vivo experiments, using a combination of pull_down assays and bimolecular fl uorescence complementation, confi rmed the interaction between Hd3a and GF14c.
 Functional analysis using either GF14c overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of fl owering.
 These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of fl owering by interacting with Hd3a.
 NIMA_related kinase) and DCW11 encoding a mitochondrial putative protein phosphatase 2C were found in our previous microarray study as down_regulated genes in the rice CW_CMS line, which lacked pollen germination ability.
 Further analysis of DCW11 revealed that DCW11 is strongly correlated with CW_CMS occurrence.
 Here we show the relationship between OsNek3 and DCW11.
 OsNek3 was preferentially expressed in mature pollen.
 A knockout mutant with Tos17 inserted into OsNek3 did not show any pollen_defective phenotype.
 On the other hand, plants overexpressing OsNek3 occasionally produced a peculiar pollen structure in which the outer cell wall of four pollen grains fused together even at the mature pollen stages, which resembled that of quartet mutants in Arabidopsis .
 OsNek3 was shown to interact with a LIM domain_containing protein, OsPLIM2b, whose expression was strongly specifi c in mature pollen, suggesting that OsNek3 might play a role in pollen germination.
 OsNek3 was shown to be down_regulated in DCW11_knockdown lines, whereas osnek3 mutation did not result in DCW11 down_regulation.
 These results suggest that OsNek3 is downstream of DCW11 in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW_CMS.
 In previous studies, we attempted to reduce phytic acid in rice seeds by silencing the 1 D _myo_inositol 3_phosphate synthase gene, RINO1 , using an antisense sequence under the control of the rice glutelin GluB_1 promoter.
 In this study, we show that the position of the caryopsis in the panicle might affect the level of gene silencing through a difference in temporal and spatial expression patterns between RINO1 and GluB_1 promoters, resulting in a large variation in Pi levels and a small increase in Pi in the transgenic seeds.
 Here, we provide evidence that DWARF14 ( D14 ) inhibits rice tillering and may act as a new component of the strigolactone_dependent branching inhibition pathway.
 The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branching with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone_defi cient and _insensitive mutants d10 and d3 , respectively.
 The d10_1 d14_1 double mutant is phenotypically indistinguishable from the d10_1 and d14_1 single mutants, consistent with the idea that D10 and D14 function in the same pathway.
 However, unlike with d10 , the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones.
 In addition, the d14 mutant contained a higher level of 2 ′ _ epi _5_deoxystrigol than the wild type.
 Positional cloning revealed that D14 encodes a protein of the α / β _fold hydrolase superfamily, some members of which play a role in metabolism or signaling of plant hormones.
 We propose that D14 functions downstream of strigolactone synthesis, as a component of hormone signaling or as an enzyme that participates in the conversion of strigolactones to the bioactive form.
 Seed storage proteins are specifi cally and highly synthesized during seed maturation and are deposited into protein bodies (PBs) via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen.
 To examine the role of ER chaperones and the relationship between ER chaperones and levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins, we generated transgenic rice plants in which the rice BiP and PDI genes were overexpressed in an endosperm_specifi c manner under the control of the rice seed storage protein glutelin promoter.
 The seed phenotype of the PDI_overexpressing transformant was almost identical to that of the wild type, whereas overexpression of BiP resulted in transgenic rice seed that displayed an opaque phenotype with fl oury and shrunken features.
 In the BiP_overexpressing line, the levels of accumulation of seed storage proteins and starch contents were signifi cantly lower compared with the wild type.
 Interestingly, overproduction of BiP in the endosperm of the transformant not only altered the morphological structure of ER_derived PB_I, but also generated unusual new PB_like structures composed of a high electron density matrix containing glutelin and BiP and a low electron density matrix containing prolamins.
 In rice panicle development, new meristems are generated sequentially in an organized manner and acquire their identity in a time_ and position_dependent manner.
 We propose that PAP2 is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity.
 Map_based cloning revealed that PAP2 encodes OsMADS34, a member of the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily of MADS_box proteins.
 All fi ve SEP subfamily genes in rice are expressed exclusively during panicle development, while their spatial and temporal expression patterns vary.
 PAP2 expression starts the earliest among the five SEP genes, and a low but signifi cant level of PAP2 mRNA was detected in the infl orescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early development of spikelet formation.
 In this study, we isolated a rice mutant showing leaf chlorosis at the early seedling stage but inhibition of root growth during the whole growth period.
 Sequence analysis showed a glutamate deletion in the highly conserved C_terminus of SPP in the mutant.
 The mutation of SPP in the mutant was verifi ed by transgenic complementation.
 SPP is constitutively expressed in all tissues.
 Subcellular localization analysis indicates that SPP is targeted to the chloroplast.
 The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14_day_old seedlings.
 Western blot analysis revealed that the Rubisco small subunit is not precisely processed in the spp mutant in 7_day_old seedlings, but the processing activity in the spp mutant is restored in 14_day_old seedlings.
 Moreover, the expression levels of Cab1R and Cab2R for the light_harvesting chlorophyll a / b _binding protein (LHCP) were highly up_regulated in the transgenic plants with overexpression of SPP .
 The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the fi rst report on the function of SPP in monocot plants.
The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype ( srs3 ) in rice was identifi ed by map_based cloning and named the SRS3 gene.
 The SRS3 gene was grouped as a member of the kinesin 13 subfamily.
 The SRS3 gene codes for a protein of 819 amino acids that contains a kinesin motor domain and a coiled_coil structure.
 Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type.
 The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type.
 The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction.
 The SRS3 protein, which is found in the crude microsomal fraction, is highly expressed in developing organs.
OsPti1a, a functional ortholog of tomato SlPti1, negatively regulates both basal resistance and R_ gene_mediated resistance in rice.
 OsOxi1 was transiently phosphorylated in response to ROS and chitin elicitor.
 Both OsOxi1 _overexpressing transgenic lines and the ospti1 amutant were highly sensitive to ROS treatment, indicating that OsOxi1 and OsPti1a are involved in ROS_mediated signaling in opposing ways.
 OsOxi1 is specifi cally expressed at infection sites where ROS are produced after inoculation with a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae .
 Overexpression of OsOxi1 enhanced basal resistance to the blast fungus, indicating that OsOxi1 positively regulates disease resistance.
 OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr_233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr_233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae ( Xoo ), suggesting that the phosphorylation of OsPti1a by OsOxi1 is essential for basal resistance to Xoo .
 Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a_dependent inhibition of the responses.
 In Arabidopsis, AtPdk1 directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, which functions as a second messenger in both biotic and abiotic stress responses.
 We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1–OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice.
 OsPdk1 interacts with OsOxi1 and phosphorylates the Ser283 residue of OsOxi1 in vitro.
 To investigate whether OsPdk1 is involved in immunity that is triggered by microbial_associated molecular patterns, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of OsPdk1 in response to chitin elicitor.
 Like OsOxi1, OsPdk1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to chitin elicitor, suggesting that OsPdk1 participates in signal transduction through pathogen recognition.
 The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae , and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae ( Xoo ).
 Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1–OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.
 Immuno_ fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that CysR10 and CysP13 were asymmetrically distributed within the PBs, with the former concentrated at the electron_dense center core region and the latter distributed mainly to the electron_lucent peripheral region.
 These results together with temporal expression data showed that the formation of prolamin_containing PB_I in the wild_type endosperm was initiated by the accumulation of CysR10 to form the center core.
 Similar, deformed PBs were observed in a CysR10 RNA interference plant line.
 A transposon_inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night.
 An epitope_tagged ISA3 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited hydrolytic activity on b_limit dextrin and amylopectin.
 We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm.
 ISA3–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm.
 Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water_soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant.
 Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules.
 Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic.
 These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice.
 OsHMA2 is a close homolog of OsHMA3, but the function of OsHMA2 is unknown.
 The translocation ratios of zinc (Zn) and Cd were clearly lower in all mutants than in the wild type, suggesting that OsHMA2 is a major transporter of Zn and Cd from roots to shoots.
 By comparing each allele in the OsHMA2 protein structure and measuring the Cd translocation ratio, we identified the C_terminal region as essential for Cd translocation into shoots.
Flowering time of rice depends strongly on photoperiodic responses.
 We previously identified a quantitative trait locus, Heading date 17 (Hd17), that is associated with a difference in flowering time between Japanese rice (Oryza sativa L, cultivars.
 Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice’s photoperiodic flowering pathway.
 In this study, we identified and characterized the Ef7 gene, one of the rice orthologs of Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3).
 The ef7 mutant HS276, which was induced by g_irradiation of the japonica rice cultivar ‘Gimbozu’, flowers late under both SD and LD conditions.
 Expression analyses of flowering time_related genes demonstrated that Ef7 negatively regulates the expression of Ghd7, which is a repressor of the photoperiodic control of rice flowering, and consequently up_regulates the expression of the downstream Ehd1 and FT_like genes under both SD and LD conditions.
 Genetic analyses with a non_functional Ghd7 allele provided further evidence that the delayed flowering of ef7 is mediated through the Ghd7 pathway.
 The analysis of light_induced expression of Ghd7 revealed that the ef7 mutant was more sensitive to red light than the wild_type plant, but the gate of Ghd7 expression was unchanged.
 Thus, our results show that Ef7 functions as a floral promoter by repressing Ghd7 expression under both SD and LD conditions.
In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear.
 These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity.
 Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo) in rice.
 OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCFCOI1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine_dependent manner.
 OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer.
 JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway.
 Furthermore, the JA_dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain.
 On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.
 The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress.
The PGR5 (PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5) gene that is required for PSI cyclic electron transport in Arabidopsis was knocked down in rice (Oryza sativa).
 In three PGR5 knockdown (KD) lines, the PGR5 protein level was reduced to 5–8% of that in the wild type, resulting in a 50% reduction in PGRL1 (PGR5_LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE 1) protein levels.
 As occurred in the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant, non_photochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence (NPQ) induction was impaired in the leaves, but the electron transport rate (ETR) was only mildly affected at high light intensity.
 The P700+ level was reduced even at low light intensity, suggesting that the PGR5 function was severely disturbed as in the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant and that the other alternative routes of electrons could not compensate the stromal redox balance.
 The CO2 fixation rate was only slightly reduced in the PGR5 KD lines.
 Despite the drastic reduction in NPQ and P700+ levels, total biomass was only slightly reduced in PGR5 KD lines grown at 370 mmol photons m–2 s–1.
 The map_based cloning results showed that the mutant was due to a point mutation in the intron of OsDGL1 (LOC_Os07g10830), which encodes the dolichyl_diphosphooligosaccharide_protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit precursor.
 OsDGL1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis DGL1, human OST48 and yeast WBP1, an essential protein subunit of the oligosaccharyl_transferase (OST) complex, which is involved in N_glycosylation in eukaryotes.
 The leaky rice mutant, Osdgl1, displayed a change of matrix polysaccharides in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, smaller root meristem and cell death in the root.
 Consistent with the known function of the OST complex in eukaryotes, the Osdgl1 mutation leads to a defect in N_glycosylation in the root.
In flowering plants, anther and pollen development is critical for male reproductive success.
 The anther cuticle and pollen exine play an essential role, and in many cereals, such as rice, orbicules/ubisch bodies are also thought to be important for pollen development.
 Here, we report that the rice ATP_binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG15, is essential for postmeiotic anther and pollen development, and is proposed to play a role in the transport of rice anther cuticle and sporopollenin precursors.
 ABCG15 is highly expressed in the tapetum at the young microspore stage, and the abcg15 mutant exhibits small, white anthers lacking mature pollen, lipidic cuticle, orbicules and pollen exine.
 Gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC_MS) analysis of the abcg15 anther cuticle revealed significant reductions in a number of wax components and aliphatic cutin monomers.
 The expression level of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the abcg15 mutant was significantly different from their levels in the wild type, possibly due to perturbations in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism.
Florigen, a protein encoded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and Heading date 3a (Hd3a) in rice, is the universal flowering hormone in plants.
Among three genes for cytosolic glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) in rice (Oryza sativa L, plants, the OsGS1;2 gene is known to be mainly expressed in surface cells of roots, but its function was not clearly understood.
 Homozygously inserted mutants showed severe reduction in active tiller number and hence panicle number at harvest.
 Other yield components, such as spikelet number per panicle, 1,000_spikelet weight and proportion of well ripened grains, were nearly identical between the mutants and wild_type plants.
 Re_introduction of OsGS1;2 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the knockout mutants successfully restored yield components to wild_type levels as well as ammonium concentration in xylem sap.
 The results indicate that GS1;2 is important in the primary assimilation of ammonium ions taken up by rice roots, with GS1;1 in the roots unable to compensate for GS1;2 functions.
 OsBOR4 is an active efflux transporter of B.
 Quantitative PCR analysis and OsBOR4 promoter–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion revealed that OsBOR4 was both highly and specifically expressed in pollen.
 The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants.
 We observed that in all Tos17 insertion lines tested, the frequency of osbor4 homozygous plants was lower than expected in the progeny of self_fertilized heterozygous plants.
 These results establish that OsBOR4 is essential for normal reproductive processes.
 Pollen from osbor4 homozygous plants elongated fewer tubes on wild_type stigmas, and tube elongation of mutant pollen was less efficient compared with the wild_type pollen, suggesting reduced competence of osbor4 mutant pollen.
 Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation.
 NPP1 and NPP6 exhibited hydrolytic activities toward ATP, UDP_glucose and the starch precursor molecule, ADP_glucose, whereas NPP2 did not recognize nucleotide sugars as substrates, but hydrolyzed UDP, ADP and adenosine 50 _phosphosulfate.
 To gain insight into the physiological function of rice NPP1, an npp1 knockout mutant was characterized.
 The ADP_glucose hydrolytic activities in shoots of npp1 rice seedlings were 8% of those of the wild type (WT), thus indicating that NPP1 is a major determinant of ADP_glucose hydrolytic activity in rice shoots.
 Importantly, when seedlings were cultured at 160 Pa CO2 under a 28 C/23 C (12 h light/12 h dark) regime, npp1 shoots and roots were larger than those of wild_type (WT) seedlings.
 Furthermore, the starch content in the npp1 shoots was higher than that of WT shoots.
 The overall data strongly indicate that NPP1 exerts a negative effect on plantgrowth and starch accumulation in shoots, especially under high CO2 concentration and high temperature conditions.
 To date, we have characterized four OsPAO genes.
 Here, we examined OsPAO7 and its gene product.
 OsPAO7 shows high identity to maize ZmPAO1, the best characterized plant PAO having TC_type activity.
 OsPAO7 seems to remain in a peripheral layer of the plant cell with the aid of its predicted signal peptide and transmembrane domain.
 Recombinant OsPAO7 prefers Spm and Spd as substrates, and it produces DAP from both substrates in a time_dependent manner, indicating that OsPAO7 is the first TC_type enzyme identified in O.
 Furthermore, OsPAO7 is specifically expressed in anthers, with an expressional peak at the bicellular pollen stage.
 The physiological function of OsPAO7 in anthers is discussed.
 In rice, the cytosolic AGPase isoform is encoded by the OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 genes, which code for the small (S2b) and large (L2) subunits of the heterotetrameric enzyme, respectively.
 In this study, we isolated several allelic missense and nonsense OsAGPL2 mutants by N_methyl_N_nitrosourea (MNU) treatment of fertilized egg cells and by TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes).
 Interestingly, seeds from three of the missense mutants (two containing T139I and A171V) were severely shriveled and had seed weight and starch content comparable with the shriveled seeds from OsAGPL2 null mutants.
 Thus, our results provide definitive evidence that starch biosynthesis during rice endosperm development is controlled predominantly by the catalytic activity of the cytoplasmic AGPase and its allosteric regulation by the effectors.
 We identified a transcription factor in rice, OsNAC111, belonging to the TERN subgroup of the NAC family that was transcriptionally upregulated after rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) inoculation.
 OsNAC111 was localized in the nucleus of rice cells and had transcriptional activation activity in yeast and rice cells.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC111 showed increased resistance to the rice blast fungus.
 Among them, two chitinase genes and one β_1,3_glucanase gene showed reduced expression in transgenic rice plants in which OsNAC111 function was suppressed by a chimeric repressor (OsNAC111_SRDX).
 OsNAC111 activated transcription from the promoters of the chitinase and β_1,3_glucanase genes in rice cells.
 These results indicate that OsNAC111 positively regulates the expression of a specific set of PR genes in the disease response and contributes to disease resistance.
 Analysis of the flanking sequences of the T_DNA insertion site revealed that an incomplete T_DNA integration resulted in enhanced constitutively expression of downstream OsGA20ox3 in the mutant.
 Transgenic plants overexpressing OsGA20ox3 showed phenotypes similar to those of the 17S_14 mutant, and the RNA interference (RNAi) lines that had decreased OsGA20ox3 expression exhibited a semidwarf phenotype.
 Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on β_glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene.
 The OsGA20ox3 RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae (causing rice blast) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (causing bacterial blight) and increased expression of defense_related genes.
 oryzae was increased by exogenous application of GA3 and decreased by S_3307 treatment.
 Together, the results provide direct evidence for a critical role of OsGA20ox3 in regulating not only plant stature but also disease resistance in rice.
 The expression of OsLSD1 was light_induced or dark_suppressed.
 Overexpression of OsLSD1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accelerated callus differentiation in transformed rice tissues and increased chlorophyll b content in transgenic rice plants.
 Antisense transgenic rice plants exhibited lesion mimic phenotype, increased expression of PR_1mRNA, and an accelerated hypersensitive response when inoculated with avirulent isolates of blast fungus.
 OsLSD1 green fluorescent protein fusion protein was located in the nucleus of tobacco cells.
 Our results suggest that OsLSD1 plays a negative role in regulating plant PCD, whereas it plays a positive role in callus differentiation.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing NH1 (NH1ox) acquire high levels of resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 These results indicate that NH1 may be involved in the regulation of SA in response to environmental changes.
 Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen_inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis.
 Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting.
 The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants.
 Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M.
 Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen_inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection.
 Our results suggest that JA plays a significant role in PR gene induction and blast resistance in rice plants.
The rice blast resistance (R) genes Pi2 and Piz_t confer broad_spectrum resistance against different sets of Magnaporthe grisea isolates.
 We first identified the Pi2 gene using a map_based cloning strategy.
 The Pi2 gene is a member of a gene cluster comprising nine gene members (named Nbs1_Pi2 to Nbs9_Pi2) and encodes a protein with a nucleotide_binding site and leucine_rich repeat (LRR) domain.
 Fine genetic mapping, molecular characterization of the Pi2 susceptible mutants, and complementation tests indicated that Nbs4_Pi2 is the Pi2 gene.
 The Piz_t gene, a Pi2 allele in the rice cultivar Toride 1, was isolated based on the Pi2 sequence information.
 A reciprocal exchange of the single amino acid between Pi2 and Piz_t did not convert the resistance specificity to each other but, rather, abolished the function of both resistance proteins.
 These results indicate that the single amino acid in the xxLxLxx motif may be critical for maintaining the recognition surface of Pi2 and Piz_t to their respective avirulence proteins.
 Here, we show that OsWRKY13 plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance.
 Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility.
 OsWRKY13 bound to the promoters of its own and at least three other genes in SA_ and JA_dependent signaling pathways.
 Furthermore, OsWRKY13 will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider_spectrum and whole_growth_stage resistance rice in breeding programs.
 Expression of OsCDR1 was activated upon treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are signal molecules in plant disease resistance responses.
 Ectopic expression of OsCDR1 in Arabidopsis and rice conferred enhanced resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
 OsCDR1 accumulates in intercellular fluids (IF) in transgenic plants.
1 overexpression in rice caused dwarfism and significantly reduced both free auxin content and cell elongation.
 Functional classification of the transcriptomic profiling revealed that most genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling inhibition were induced and repressed, respectively.
1 overexpression reduces auxin content, inhibits cell growth and cell wall loosening, and enhances resistance to a fungal pathogen.
 A transposon insertion mutation (Osssi2_Tos17) and RNAi_mediated knockdown of OsSSI2 (OsSSI2_kd) reduced the oleic acid (18.
The rice xa5 gene for disease resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae has been positionally cloned and encodes the gamma subunit of transcription factor IIA (TFIIAγ).
 xa5 is unusual in that it is recessive and does not conform to one of the typical resistance gene structural classes.
 The orthologous floral regulators—rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO)—integrate circadian clock and external light signals into mRNA expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) group floral inducer.
 Here, we report that the rice Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene, which confers SD promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes a B_type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome.
 Ehd1 mRNA was induced by 1_wk SD treatment, and Ehd1 may promote flowering by inducing FT_like gene expression only under SD conditions.
 Here we show that xa13, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development.
 The dominant allele, Xa13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development.
 Promoter mutations in Xa13 cause down_regulation of expression during host–pathogen interaction, resulting in the fully recessive xa13 that confers race_specific resistance.
 The recessive xa13 allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance.
 Here, we clone and characterize DST (drought and salt tolerance)—a previously unknown zinc finger transcription factor that negatively regulates stomatal closure by direct modulation of genes related to H2O2 homeostasis—and identify a novel pathway for the signal transduction of DST_mediated H2O2_induced stomatal closure.
 Loss of DST function increases stomatal closure and reduces stomatal density, consequently resulting in enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice.
 Longitudinal sections of the leaf sheaths revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis is reduced, which explains the short leaf sheaths.
 In addition, the number of crown roots was smaller and the growth of branch roots was weaker than those in the wild_type plant.
 Further, under darkness, brd1 showed constitutive photomorphogenesis.
2_kb deletion was detected in the genomic region of OsBR6ox (a rice BR_6_oxidase gene) in the brd1 mutant.
 These results indicate that BRs are involved in many morphological and physiological processes in rice, including the elongation and unrolling of leaves, development of tillers, skotomorphogenesis, root differentiation, and reproductive growth, and that the defect of BR_6_oxidase caused the brd1phenotype.
Several brittle culm mutations of rice (Oryza sativa) causing fragility of plant tissues have been identified genetically but not characterized at a molecular level.
 We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9.
 Cellulose contents were dramatically decreased (8.
 We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down_regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast_derived elicitors.
 Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus.
 OsMT2b_overexpressing cells showed reduced elicitor_induced hydrogen peroxide production.
 cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility.
 Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence.
 Type 2 spikelets (approximately 55%) had viable pollen grains, but anthers failed to dehisce and/or synchronize with anthesis due to failure in septum degradation and stomium breakage, resulting in sterility.
 Type 3 spikelets (approximately 20%) had normal fertility.
 In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type.
 The Ds insertion responsible for the aid1 mutation was mapped within the coding region of the AID1 gene on chromosome 6, which is predicted to encode a novel protein of 426 amino acids with a single MYB domain.
 The MYB domain of AID1 is closely related to that of the telomere_binding proteins of human, mouse, and Arabidopsis, and of single MYB domain transcriptional regulators in plants such as PcMYB1 and ZmIBP1.
 AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild_type plants, but not in mutant plants.
 Here, the OsRAA1 (Oryza sativa Root Architecture Associated 1) gene has been characterized molecularly.
 OsRAA1 encodes a 12.
0_kD protein that has 58% homology to the AtFPF1 (Flowering Promoting Factor 1) in Arabidopsis, which has not been reported as modulating root development yet.
 OsMADS18 from rice (Oryza sativa) belongs to the phylogenetically defined AP1/SQUA group.
 The MADS box genes of this group have functions in plant development, like controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, determination of floral organ identity, and regulation of fruit maturation.
 Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated.
 Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors.
 Surprisingly, overexpression of OsMADS18 in Arabidopsis caused a phenotype closely resembling the ap1 mutant.
 Yeast two_hybrid experiments showed that some of the natural partners of AP1 interact with OsMADS18, suggesting that the OsMADS18 overexpression phenotype in Arabidopsis is likely to be due to the subtraction of AP1 partners from active transcription complexes.
 Thus, when compared to AP1, OsMADS18 during evolution seems to have conserved the mechanistic properties of protein_protein interactions, although it cannot complement the AP1 function.
 Suppression of OsMAPK6 expression by RNA interference resulted in a strong reduction of pathogen_induced Phe ammonia_lyase mRNA, whereas the mRNA level of another rice MAPK, OsMAPK5a, was highly increased.
 Silencing of a small GTPase, OsRac1, by RNA interference or loss_of_function mutation (d1) of the heterotrimeric G_protein a_subunit gene resulted in a strong reduction of the OsMAPK6 protein levels and of kinase activation by a sphingolipid elicitor.
 Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with OsRac1 and OsMAPK6 proteins showed that OsMAPK6 is closely associated with the active form of OsRac1, but not with inactive forms of OsRac1.
 In this study, a T_DNA insertional rice (Oryza sativa) mutant exhibiting a temperature_sensitive defect in root elongation was isolated.
 The aberrant root morphology of the gna1 mutant includes shortening of roots, disruption of microtubules, and shrinkage of cells in the root elongation zone.
Molecular genetic studies of plant dwarf mutants have indicated that gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) are two major factors that determine plant height; dwarf mutants that are caused by other defects are relatively rare, especially in monocot species.
 In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions.
 Positional cloning of DGL1 revealed that it encodes a 60_kD microtubule_severing katanin_like protein.
 The protein was found to be important in cell elongation and division, based on the observed cell phenotypes.
 The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant.
 Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule_severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR_deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization.
 These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1_mediated microtubule organization causes up_regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling.
 The expression of OsPTF1 is Pi starvation induced in roots while constitutively expressed in shoots, as shown by northern_blot analysis.
 Overexpression of OsPTF1 enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation in transgenic rice.
 Tillering ability, root and shoot biomass, and phosphorus content of transgenic rice plants were about 30% higher than those of the wild_type plants in Pi_deficient conditions in hydroponic experiments.
 In soil pot and field experiments, more than 20% increase in tiller number, panicle weight, and phosphorus content was observed in transgenic plants compared to wild_type plants at low_Pi levels.
 In Pi_deficient conditions, transgenic rice plants showed significantly higher total root length and root surface area, which results in a higher instantaneous Pi uptake rate over their wild_type counterparts.
 Microarray analysis for transgenic plants overexpressing OsPTF1 has been performed to investigate the down_stream regulation of OsPTF1.
 An RNA interference approach was applied to knock down two OsDCLs, OsDCL1 and OsDCL4, respectively.
 Strong loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants that expressed inverted repeats of OsDCL1 resulted in developmental arrest at the seedling stage, and weak loss of function of OsDCL1IR transformants caused pleiotropic developmental defects.
 Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice.
 The structural changes in the amylopectin increased the gelatinization temperature of endosperm starch.
 In summary, this study strongly suggested that amylopectin chains are synthesized by the coordinated actions of SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa isoforms.
Lignin content and composition are two important agronomic traits for the utilization of agricultural residues.
 The result shows that the gh2 mutant is a lignin_deficient mutant, and GH2 encodes a cinnamyl_alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD).
 Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity.
 When expressed in Escherichia coli, purified recombinant GH2 was found to exhibit strong catalytic ability toward coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde, while the mutant protein gh2 completely lost the corresponding CAD and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities.
 Further phenotypic analysis of the gh2 mutant plants revealed that the p_hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and sinapyl monomers were reduced in almost the same ratio compared to the wild type.
 Our results suggest GH2 acts as a primarily multifunctional CAD to synthesize coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol precursors in rice lignin biosynthesis.
Leaf senescence is a developmentally programmed degeneration process, which is fine tuned by a complex regulatory network for plant fitness.
 However, molecular regulation of leaf senescence is poorly understood, especially in rice (Oryza sativa), an important staple crop for more than half of the world population.
 Here, we report a novel nuclear_localized CCCH_type zinc finger protein, Oryza sativa delay of the onset of senescence (OsDOS), involved in delaying leaf senescence in rice.
 The expression of OsDOS was down_regulated during natural leaf senescence, panicle development, and pollination, although its transcripts were accumulated in various organs.
 RNAi knockdown of OsDOS caused an accelerated age_dependent leaf senescence, whereas its overexpression produced a marked delay of leaf senescence, suggesting that it acts as a negative regulator for leaf senescence.
 A genome_wide expression analysis further confirmed its negative regulation for leaf senescence and revealed that, in particular, the jasmonate (JA) pathway was found to be hyperactive in the OsDOS RNAi transgenic lines but impaired in the OsDOS overexpressing transgenic lines, indicating that this pathway is likely involved in the OsDOS_mediated delaying of leaf senescence.
 Together, these results indicate that OsDOS is a novel nuclear protein that delays leaf senescence likely, at least in part, by integrating developmental cues to the JA pathway.
 Molecular and biochemical studies revealed that there are eight IPT genes, OsIPT1 to OsIPT8, in the rice genome, including a pseudogene, OsIPT6.
 Overexpression of OsIPTs in transgenic rice inhibited root development and promoted axillary bud growth, indicating that OsIPTs are functional in vivo.
 Expression of two OsIPT genes, OsIPT2 and OsIPT3, was up_regulated in response to the induction of KNOX protein function with similar kinetics to those of down_regulation of GA 20_oxidase genes, target genes of KNOX proteins in dicots.
 These results suggest that OsIPT2 and OsIPT3 have unique roles in the developmental process, which is controlled by KNOX proteins, rather than in the maintenance of bioactive CK levels in rice.
 On the basis of these findings, we concluded that KNOX protein simultaneously decreases GA biosynthesis and increases de novo CK biosynthesis through the induction of OsIPT2 and OsIPT3 expression, and the resulting high_CK and low_GA condition is required for formation and maintenance of the meristem.
 To investigate the function of KRPs in rice development, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing the Orysa;KRP1 gene.
 Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development.
 Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling.
 Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation.
 Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase_like D1 (OsCSLD1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack OsCSLD1 function develop abnormal root hairs.
 Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild_type plants, we propose that OsCSLD1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation.
 Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that OsCSLD1 is expressed in only root hair cells.
 Furthermore, OsCSLD1 is the only member of the four rice CSLD genes that shows root_specific expression.
 Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that OsCSLD1 may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair_specific members of this family of proteins.
 Plants overexpressing OsYUCCA1 exhibited increased IAA levels and characteristic auxin overproduction phenotypes, whereas plants expressing antisense OsYUCCA1 cDNA displayed defects that are similar to those of rice auxin_insensitive mutants.
 OsYUCCA1 was expressed in almost all of the organs tested, but its expression was restricted to discrete areas, including the tips of leaves, roots, and vascular tissues, where it overlapped with expression of a b_glucuronidase reporter gene controlled by the auxin_responsive DR5 promoter.
 These observations are consistent with an important role for the rice enzyme OsYUCCA1 in IAA biosynthesis via the tryptophan_dependent pathway.
 Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and WOX3 in rice leaf development.
 Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice WOX3 is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS).
 YAB3 RNAi induced twisted and knotted leaves lacking specialized structures such as ligule and auricles, while no phenotypic change was observed in YAB3 overexpression plants, suggesting that rice YAB3 may be required for leaf cell growth and differentiation.
 Overexpression of WOX3 repressed YAB3 and showed a YAB3 RNAi phenotype.
 The expression of class I KNOTTED_LIKE HOMEOBOX (KNOX) genes was ectopically induced in leaves of YAB3 RNAi or WOX3 overexpression plants.
 Data from inducible WOX3 expression and DNA_protein interaction assays suggested that WOX3 acted as a transcriptional repressor of YAB3.
 These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, WOX3, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development.
 Overexpression of YAB1 in transgenic rice resulted in a semidwarf phenotype that could be fully rescued by applied GA.
 Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2.
 Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA_responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter.
 In addition, the expression of YAB1 was deregulated in GA biosynthesis and signaling mutants and could be either transiently induced by GA or repressed by a GA inhibitor.
 Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA_mediated repression of GA3ox2.
 These data together suggest that YAB1 is involved in the feedback regulation of GA biosynthesis in rice.
 We show that OsSRT1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein with higher levels in rapidly dividing tissues.
 OsSRT1 RNA interference induced an increase of histone H3K9 (lysine_9 of H3) acetylation and a decrease of H3K9 dimethylation, leading to H2O2 production, DNA fragmentation, cell death, and lesions mimicking plant hypersensitive responses during incompatible interactions with pathogens, whereas overexpression of OsSRT1 enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsSRT1 down_regulation induced histone H3K9 acetylation on the transposable elements and some of the hypersensitive response_related genes, suggesting that these genes may be among the primary targets of deacetylation regulated by OsSRT1.
 In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl_deficient mutant, yellow_green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow_green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development.
 Genetic analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of ygl1 was caused by a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene.
 The ygl1 locus was mapped to chromosome 5 and isolated by map_based cloning.
 A missense mutation was found in a highly conserved residue of YGL1 in the ygl1 mutant, resulting in reduction of the enzymatic activity.
 YGL1 is constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its expression is not significantly affected in the ygl1 mutant.
 Interestingly, the mRNA expression of the cab1R gene encoding the Chl a/b_binding protein was severely suppressed in the ygl1 mutant.
 Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings.
 Rice cells overexpressing OsKAT1 also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K1 content.
 These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K1 channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt_sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1.
 The expression of OsKAT1 was restricted to internodes and rachides of wild_type rice, whereas other Shaker family genes were expressed in various organs.
 These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K1 channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na1.
 Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively.
 Semiquantitative reverse transcription_polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium.
 Here, we investigated the role of OsMADS51, a type I MADS_box gene in the short_day (SD) promotion pathway in rice (Oryza sativa).
 In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering.
 Transcript levels of three flowering regulators—Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a—were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged.
 Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs.
 In ectopic expression lines, transcript levels of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a were increased, but those of OsGI and Hd1 remained the same.
 These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a.
 To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed.
 In Ehd1 RNA interference plants, OsMADS51 expression was not affected, supporting our conclusion that the MADS_box gene functions upstream of Ehd1.
 However, in OsGI antisense plants, the OsMADS51 transcript level was reduced.
 These results demonstrate that OsMADS51 functions downstream of OsGI.
 In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1.
 Microarray analysis showed that the expression of a number of the genes involved in Fe(II) acquisition was greatly stimulated in the naat1 mutant.
 OsMT2b was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots.
 In contrast with wild_type plants, OsMT2b_RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas OsMT2b_overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots.
 Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of OsMT2b to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.
 In this work, two OsPHR genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtPHR1.
 Our results showed that both OsPHR1 and OsPHR2 are involved in Pi_starvation signaling pathway by regulation of the expression of Pi_starvation_induced genes, whereas only OsPHR2 overexpression results in the excessive accumulation of Pi in shoots under Pi_sufficient conditions.
 Under Pi_sufficient conditions, overexpression of OsPHR2 mimics Pi_starvation stress in rice with enhanced root elongation and proliferated root hair growth, suggesting the involvement of OsPHR2 in Pi_dependent root architecture alteration by both systematic and local pathways.
 The mechanism behind the OsPHR2 regulated Pi accumulation will provide useful approaches to develop smart plants with high Pi efficiency.
 Genetic analysis has revealed that most of them function in flowering time control, reproductive organ development, and vegetative growth.
 Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age_dependent manner in the shoots and roots.
 These results suggest that OsMADS26 induces multiple responses that are related to various stresses.
 In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins.
 Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in whichthe number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered.
 Map_based cloning and genetic complementation analyses demonstrated that Nal1 encodes a plant_specific protein with unknown biochemical function.
 We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity.
 These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth.
 Ostrxm showed green tissue_specific and light_responsive mRNA expression.
 Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol_dependent insulin b_chain reduction activity in vitro.
 RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale_green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content.
 Ostrxm RNAi plants showed remarkably decreased Fv/Fm values under high irradiance conditions (1,000 mmol m22 s21) with delayed recovery.
 Two_dimensional electrophoresis and matrix_assisted laser_desorption/ionization time_of_flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants.
 Furthermore, 2_Cys peroxiredoxin, a known target of thioredoxin, was present in oxidized forms, and hydrogen peroxide levels were increased in Ostrxm RNAi plants.
 The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions.
 We discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short_ and long_day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway.
 This phenotype in the ehd2 mutants suggests that Ehd2 is pivotal for the floral transition in rice.
 Map_based cloning revealed that Ehd2 encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) gene, which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays).
 Ehd2 mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around the shoot apex and in roots, patterns that are similar to those of ID1.
 To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering_time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT_like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild_type plants and the ehd2 mutants.
 Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short_ and long_day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up_regulating Ehd1 and by up_regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
 Heterologous expression of OsFRDL1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for citrate.
 Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL1 was localized at the pericycle cells of the roots.
 Taken together, our results indicate that OsFRDL1 is a citrate transporter localized at the pericycle cells, which is necessary for efficient translocation of Fe to the shoot as a Fe_citrate complex.
 Expression of OsbZIP23 is strongly induced by a wide spectrum of stresses, including drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatments, while other stress_responsive genes of this family are slightly induced only by one or two of the stresses.
 Transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional activator, and the sequences at the N terminus (amino acids 1–59) and a region close to the C terminus (amino acids 210–240) are required for the transactivation activity.
 Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP23 showed significantly improved tolerance to drought and high_salinity stresses and sensitivity to ABA.
 On the other hand, a null mutant of this gene showed significantly decreased sensitivity to a high concentration of ABA and decreased tolerance to high_salinity and drought stress, and this phenotype can be complemented by transforming the OsbZIP23 back into the mutant.
 Collectively, these results indicate that OsbZIP23 functions as a transcriptional regulator that can regulate the expression of a wide spectrum of stress_related genes in response to abiotic stresses through an ABA_dependent regulation pathway.
 We propose that OsbZIP23 is a major player of the bZIP family in rice for conferring ABA_dependent drought and salinity tolerance and has high potential usefulness in genetic improvement of stress tolerance.
 The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea.
 The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild_type lemma.
 Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry.
 Although the proteins have been studied from various organisms and at different growth stages, their roles in seed development have not been well elucidated.
 Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage.
 These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly.
 Purified OsALDH7 protein showed enzyme activities to malondialdehyde, acetaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde.
 These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation.
 These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation.
 Using rice (Oryza sativa) as a study system, we employ reverse genetic tools (knockout mutants and RNA interference) to demonstrate that Os_CASTOR and Os_POLLUX are indispensable for mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.
 Furthermore, a cross_species complementation test indicates that Os_POLLUX can restore nodulation, but not rhizobial infection, to a Medicago truncatula dmi1 mutant.
 Furthermore, the OsPLDb1_knockdown plants exhibited increased resistance to the infection of major pathogens of rice, Pyricularia grisea and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae.
 Here, we show that OsMYB3R_2 functions in both stress and developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R_2 exhibited enhanced cold tolerance.
 We show that OsMYB3R_2 specifically bound to a mitosis_specific activator cis_element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2.
 In addition, overexpression of OsMYB3R_2 in rice led to higher transcript levels of several G2/M phase_specific genes, including OsCycB1;1, OsCycB2;1, OsCycB2;2, and OsCDC20.
1, than those in OsMYB3R_2 antisense lines or wild_type plants in response to cold treatment.
 Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increased cell mitotic index in overexpressed transgenic lines of OsMYB3R_2 after cold treatment.
 The level of cellular free proline was increased in the overexpressed rice lines of OsMYB3R_2 and OsCycB1;1 transgenic plants compared with wild_type plants under the cold treatment.
 These results suggest that OsMYB3R_2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress.
 Here, we show V3 and St1, which encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), RNRL1, and RNRS1, respectively.
 RNRL1 and RNRS1 are highly expressed in the shoot base and in young leaves, and the expression of the genes that function in plastid transcription/translation and in photosynthesis is altered in v3 and st1 mutants, indicating that a threshold activity of RNR is required for chloroplast biogenesis in developing leaves.
 Two genes, AP37 and AP59, representing subgroups I and II, respectively, were functionally characterized.
 The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage.
 Transgenic rice plants that overexpressed TDC accumulated higher levels of serotonin than the wild type and showed delayed senescence of rice leaves.
 However, transgenic rice plants, in which expression of TDC was suppressed through an RNA interference (RNAi) system, produced less serotonin and senesced faster than the wild type, suggesting that serotonin is involved in attenuating leaf senescence.
 Results of TDC overexpression and TDC RNAi plants suggest that TDC plays a rate_limiting role for serotonin accumulation, but the synthesis of serotonin depends on an absolute amount of tryptophan accumulation by the coordinate induction of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes.
 Rice plants overexpressing BU1 (BU1.
 The expression of the rice (Oryza sativa) SAUR39 gene showed rapid induction by transient change in different environmental factors, including auxin, nitrogen, salinity, cytokinin, and anoxia.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the SAUR39 gene resulted in lower shoot and root growth, altered shoot morphology, smaller vascular tissue, and lower yield compared with wild_type plants.
 The SAUR39 gene was expressed at higher levels in older leaves, unlike auxin biosynthesis, which occurs largely in the meristematic region.
 The transgenic plants had a lower auxin level and a reduced polar auxin transport as well as the down_regulation of some putative auxin biosynthesis and transporter genes.
 Biochemical analysis also revealed that transgenic plants had lower chlorophyll content, higher levels of anthocyanin, abscisic acid, sugar, and starch, and faster leaf senescence compared with wild_type plants at the vegetative stage.
 Taken together, the results suggest that SAUR39 acts as a negative regulator for auxin synthesis and transport.
 Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), bacterial streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola (Xoc), and fungal blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea are devastating diseases of rice worldwide.
 Here, we report a gain_of_function rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, tld1_D, characterized by (and named for) an increased number of tillers, enlarged leaf angles, and dwarfism.
 The activation of TLD1 reduced the IAA maxima at the lamina joint, shoot base, and nodes, resulting in subsequent alterations in plant architecture and tissue patterning but enhancing drought tolerance.
 Accordingly, the decreased level of free IAA in tld1_D due to the conjugation of IAA with amino acids greatly facilitated the accumulation of late_embryogenesis abundant mRNA compared with the wild type.
 Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild_type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages.
 The dsm1 mutants lost water more rapidly than wild_type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought_sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants.
 The predicted DSM1 protein belongs to a B3 subgroup of plant Raf_like MAPKKKs and was localized in the nucleus.
 By real_time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold.
1, were sharply down_regulated compared to wild type, suggesting that DSM1 may be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling.
 Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3#_diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the dsm1 mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity.
 Overexpression of DSM1 in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage.
 Together, these results suggest that DSM1 might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice.
Phosphate homeostasis was studied in a monocotyledonous model plant through the characterization of the PHO1 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genome has three PHO1 homologs, which cluster with the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPHO1 and AtPHO1;H1, the only two genes known to be involved in root_to_shoot transfer of phosphate.
 In contrast to the Arabidopsis PHO1 gene family, all three rice PHO1 genes have a cis_natural antisense transcript located at the 5# end of the genes.
 The most abundantly expressed gene was OsPHO1;2 in the roots, for both sense and antisense transcripts.
 However, while the OsPHO1;2 sense transcript was relatively stable under various nutrient deficiencies, the antisense transcript was highly induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency.
 Characterization of Ospho1;1 and Ospho1;2 insertion mutants revealed that only Osph1;2 mutants had defects in Pi homeostasis, namely strong reduction in Pi transfer from root to shoot, which was accompanied by low_shoot and high_root Pi.
 Our data identify OsPHO1;2 as playing a key role in the transfer of Pi from roots to shoots in rice, and indicate that this gene could be regulated by its cis_natural antisense transcripts.
 Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of PHO1 homologs in monocotyledons and dicotyledons revealed the emergence of a distinct clade of PHO1 genes in dicotyledons, which include members having roles other than long_distance Pi transport.
 OsKu70 transcript was detected constitutively in every tissue and developmental stage examined and also in undifferentiated callus cells in rice.
 Yeast two_hybrid and in vitro pull_down experiments revealed that OsKu70 physically interacts with OsKu80.
 We obtained loss_of_function osku70 T_DNA knockout mutant lines and constructed transgenic rice plants that overexpress the OsKu70 gene in the sense (35S.
 Here, we demonstrate that exogenously administered ABA enhances basal resistance of rice (Oryza sativa) against the brown spot_causing ascomycete Cochliobolus miyabeanus.
 MYBS3 is a single DNA_binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice.
 In this study, we observed that MYBS3 also plays a critical role in cold adaptation in rice.
 Gain_ and loss_of_function analyses indicated that MYBS3 was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice.
 Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing MYBS3 tolerated 4 C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions.
 Transcription profiling of transgenic rice overexpressing or underexpressing MYBS3 led to the identification of many genes in the MYBS3_mediated cold signaling pathway.
 Several genes activated by MYBS3 as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species.
 Surprisingly, MYBS3 repressed the well_known DREB1/CBF_dependent cold signaling pathway in rice, and the repression appears to act at the transcriptional level.
 DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while MYBS3 responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short_ and long_term cold stress in rice.
 Here, we report the results of a functional genomics approach that identified a rice NAC (an acronym for NAM [No Apical Meristem], ATAF1_2, and CUC2 [Cup_Shaped Cotyledon]) domain gene, OsNAC10, which improved performance of transgenic rice plants under field drought conditions.
 Overexpression of OsNAC10 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter GOS2 and the root_specific promoter RCc3 increased the plant tolerance to drought, high salinity, and low temperature at the vegetative stage.
Grass plants develop distinct inflorescences and spikelets that determine grain yields.
 OsMADS34 encodes a MADS box protein containing a short carboxyl terminus without transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells.
 We demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of OsMADS34 in roots, leaves, and primordia of inflorescence and spikelet organs.
 Compared with the wild type, osmads34 mutants developed altered inflorescence morphology, with an increased number of primary branches and a decreased number of secondary branches.
 In addition, osmads34 mutants displayed a decreased spikelet number and altered spikelet morphology, with lemma/leaf_like elongated sterile lemmas.
 Moreover, analysis of the double mutant osmads34 osmads1 suggests that OsMADS34 specifies the identities of floral organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another rice SEP_like gene, OsMADS1.
 Collectively, our study suggests that the origin and diversification of OsMADS34 and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets.
Starch biosynthesis is important for plant development and is a critical factor in crop quality and nutrition.
 As a complex metabolic pathway, the regulation of starch biosynthesis is still poorly understood.
 We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch biosynthesis by gene coexpression analysis in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Starch synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in seeds; sink tissues) and type II (in vegetative tissues; source tissues), and 307 and 621 coexpressed genes are putatively involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice seeds and vegetative tissues, respectively.
 Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1), an APETALA2/ethylene_responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and RSR1 deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds.
 Seeds of the knockout mutant rsr1 consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature.
 In addition, rsr1 mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield.
 In contrast, RSR1 overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature.
 Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in rsr1 results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in RSR1_overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch.
 These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of RSR1, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition.
In rice (Oryza sativa), trans_acting small interfering RNA (ta_siRNA) is essential for shoot development, including shoot apical meristem (SAM) formation and leaf morphogenesis.
 The rice wavy leaf1 (waf1) mutant has been identified as an embryonic mutant resembling shoot organization1 (sho1) and sho2, homologs of a loss_of_function mutant of DICER_LIKE4 and a hypomorphic mutant of ARGONAUTE7, respectively, which both act in the ta_siRNA production pathway.
 About half of the waf1 mutants showed seedling lethality due to defects in SAM maintenance, but the rest survived to the reproductive phase and exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes in leaf morphology and floral development.
 Map_based cloning of WAF1 revealed that it encodes an RNA methyltransferase, a homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HUA ENHANCER1.
 The reduced accumulation of small RNAs in waf1 indicated that the stability of the small RNA was decreased.
 A double mutant between sho and waf1 showed an enhanced SAM defect, suggesting that the amount and/or quality of ta_siRNA is crucial for SAM maintenance.
 Our results indicate that stabilization of small RNAs by WAF1 is indispensable for rice development, especially for SAM maintenance and leaf morphogenesis governed by the ta_siRNA pathway.
 In addition, the inconsistent relationship between the amount of small RNAs and the level of the target mRNA in waf1 suggest that there is a complex regulatory mechanism that modifies the effects of microRNA/ta_siRNA on the expression of the target gene.
Rice (Oryza sativa) plants carrying the Pi_i resistance gene to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae restrict invaded fungus in infected tissue via hypersensitive reaction or response (HR), which is accompanied by rapid ethylene production and formation of small HR lesions.
 Ethylene biosynthesis has been implicated to be important for blast resistance; however, the individual roles of ethylene and cyanide, which are produced from the precursor 1_aminocyclopropane_1_carboxylic acid, remain unevaluated.
 The amounts of zeaxanthin and ABA were significantly reduced in two allelic dsm2 mutants after drought stress compared with the wild type.
 Under drought stress conditions, the mutant leaves lost water faster than the wild type and the photosynthesis rate, biomass, and grain yield were significantly reduced, whereas malondialdehyde level and stomata aperture were increased in the mutant.
 The mutant had significantly lower maximal efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry and nonphotochemical quenching capacity than the wild type, indicating photoinhibition in photosystem II and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation.
 Overexpression of DSM2 in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to drought and oxidative stresses and increases of the xanthophylls and nonphotochemical quenching.
 DSM2 is a chloroplast protein, and the response of DSM2 to environmental stimuli is distinctive from the other two BCH members in rice.
 We conclude that the DSM2 gene significantly contributes to control of the xanthophyll cycle and ABA synthesis, both of which play critical roles in the establishment of drought resistance in rice.
 Here, we show that GH3_2, encoding an indole_3_acetic acid (IAA)_amido synthetase, mediates a broad_spectrum resistance to bacterial Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola and fungal Magnaporthe grisea in rice (Oryza sativa).
 oryzae pv oryzae, X.
 oryzae pv oryzicola, and M.
 GH3_2 is likely contributing to a minor quantitative trait locus for broad_spectrum resistance.
 Activation of GH3_2 inactivates IAA by catalyzing the formation of an IAA_amino acid conjugate, which results in the suppression of expansin genes.
 Thus, GH3_2 mediates basal resistance by suppressing pathogen_induced IAA accumulation.
 It is expected that, regulated by a pathogen_induced strong promoter, GH3_2 alone may be used for breeding rice with a broad_spectrum disease resistance.
 Map_based cloning identified LTN1 as LOC_Os05g48390, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis PHO2, which plays important roles in Pi starvation signaling.
 Analysis of transgenic plants harboring a LTN1 promoter.
 The gene encodes a NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC)_like transcription factor and the function of the transcript is abolished in B_toxicity_tolerant cultivars.
 ABL1 is expressed in various tissues and is induced by the hormones ABA and indole_3_acetic acid and stress conditions including salinity, drought, and osmotic pressure.
 The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity.
 The ABL1 protein is localized to the nucleus and can directly bind ABA_responsive elements (ABREs; G_box) in vitro.
 A gene expression analysis by DNA chip hybridization confirms that a large proportion of down_regulated genes of abl1 are involved in stress responses, consistent with the transcriptional activating effects of ABL1.
 Further studies indicate that ABL1 regulates the plant stress responses by regulating a series of ABRE_containing WRKY family genes.
 In addition, the abl1 mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous indole_3_acetic acid, and some ABRE_containing genes related to auxin metabolism or signaling are altered under ABL1 deficiency, suggesting that ABL1 modulates ABA and auxin responses by directly regulating the ABRE_containing genes.
 Expression of a b_glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporter gene driven by the OsPT8 promoter showed that OsPT8 is expressed in various tissue organs from roots to seeds independent of Pi supply.
 OsPT8 was able to complement a yeast Pi_uptake mutant and increase Pi accumulation of Xenopus laevis oocytes when supplied with micromolar 33Pi concentrations at their external solution, indicating that it has a high affinity for Pi transport.
 Overexpression of OsPT8 resulted in excessive Pi in both roots and shoots and Pi toxic symptoms under the high_Pi supply condition.
 In contrast, knockdown of OsPT8 by RNA interference decreased Pi uptake and plant growth under both high_ and low_Pi conditions.
 Moreover, OsPT8 suppression resulted in an increase of phosphorus content in the panicle axis and in a decrease of phosphorus content in unfilled grain hulls, accompanied by lower seed_setting rate.
 Altogether, our data suggest that OsPT8 is involved in Pi homeostasis in rice and is critical for plant growth and development.
 Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT TAPETAL CELL1 (PTC1), which controls programmed tapetal development and functional pollen formation.
 The evolutionary significance of PTC1 was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
 PTC1 encodes a PHD_finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild_type tapetal cells initiate a typical apoptosis_like cell death.
 Even though ptc1 mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms1 in a lack of tapetal DNA fragmentation, delayed tapetal degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the ptc1 mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled tapetal proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis_like tapetal death.
 Microarray analysis indicated that 2,417 tapetum_ and microspore_expressed genes, which are principally associated with tapetal development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in ptc1 anthers.
 Moreover, the regulatory role of PTC1 in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS1 and other rice anther developmental regulators.
 These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of PTC1/MS1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development.
 The expression level of OASA2 in plants homozygous and heterozygous for modified OASA2 was similar to that of nontransformants, suggesting that OASA2 transcription in GT plants was controlled in the same manner as endogenous OASA2, and that GT could lead to a lower risk of gene silencing than in conventional overexpression approaches.
Leaf rolling is considered an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding.
 To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T_DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling.
 Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling.
 Bulliform cell number and size increased in oul1 and Roc5 cosuppression plants but were reduced in Roc5_overexpressing lines.
 The data indicate that Roc5 negatively regulates bulliform cell fate and development.
 The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5_overexpressing lines, and PFL_RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function.
 These are, to our knowledge, the first functional data for a gene encoding a homeodomain leucine zipper class IV transcriptional factor in rice that modulates leaf rolling.
 We here report the isolation and characterization of a mutation in the rice (Oryza sativa) OsSUT2 gene.
 Expression of OsSUT2_green fluorescent protein in rice revealed that OsSUT2 localizes to the tonoplast.
 Analysis of the OsSUT2 promoter.
The successful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis relies on the establishment and subsequent release of cohesion between replicated chromatids.
 Here, we isolated and dissected the functions of OsREC8, a rice (Oryza sativa) REC8 homolog, using two null Osrec8 mutants.
 We showed that OsREC8 encodes a protein that localized to meiotic chromosomes from approximately meiotic interphase to metaphase I.
 Homologous pairing and telomere bouquet formation were abnormal in Osrec8 meiocytes.
 Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments on Osrec8 meiocytes demonstrated that the mutation eliminated meiotic centromeric cohesion completely during prophase I and also led to the bipolar orientation of the kinetochores during the first meiotic division and accordingly resulted in premature separation of sister chromatid during meiosis I.
 Immunolocalization analyses revealed that the loading of PAIR2, PAIR3, OsMER3, and ZEP1 all depended on OsREC8.
 By contrast, the presence of the OsREC8 signal in pair2, pair3, Osmer3, and zep1 mutants indicated that the loading of OsREC8 did not rely on these four proteins.
 These results suggest that OsREC8 has several essential roles in the meiotic processes.
Plant height is a decisive factor in plant architecture.
 Rice (Oryza sativa) plants have the potential for rapid internodal elongation, which determines plant height.
 A rice AP2/ERF gene, OsEATB (for ERF protein associated with tillering and panicle branching) was cloned from indica rice variety 9311.
 Ectopic expression of OsEATB showed that the cross talk between ethylene and gibberellin, which is mediated by OsEATB, might underlie differences in rice internode elongation.
 Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that OsEATB restricts ethylene_induced enhancement of gibberellin responsiveness during the internode elongation process by down_regulating the gibberellin biosynthetic gene, ent_kaurene synthase A.
 Plant height is negatively correlated with tiller number, and higher yields are typically obtained from dwarf crops.
 OsEATB reduces rice plant height and panicle length at maturity, promoting the branching potential of both tillers and spikelets.
 This spatial distribution pattern was dramatically altered in the glup4 mutants.
 Moreover, all three independent glup4 allelic lines displayed the novel appearance of a large dilated, structurally complex paramural body containing proglutelins, a_globulins, membrane biomarkers for the Golgi apparatus, prevacuolar compartment, PSV, and the endoplasmic reticulum luminal chaperones BiP and protein disulfide isomerase as well as b_glucan.
 These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function.
 Here, we report that OsDIS1 (for Oryza sativa drought_induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought_stress signal transduction in rice (O.
 The expression of OsDIS1 was up_regulated by drought treatment.
 In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that OsDIS1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that the conserved region of the RING finger was required for the activity.
 Transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and rice protoplasts indicated that OsDIS1 was localized predominantly in the nucleus.
 Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance.
 Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought_responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions.
 Yeast two_hybrid screening showed that OsDIS1 interacted with OsNek6 (for O.
 benthamiana leaves indicated that OsNek6 was degraded by OsDIS1 via the 26S proteasome_dependent pathway and that this degradation was abolished by the OsDIS1(H71Y) mutation, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity.
 Together, these results demonstrate that OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress_related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice.
 Three OsPHF1 allelic mutants carrying one_point mutations at the fifth WD_repeat motif and two at the transmembrane helix, respectively, showed arsenate resistance and severely reduced Pi accumulation.
 The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low_affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high_affinity Pi transporter OsPT8.
 Mutation of OsPHF1 also reduced Pi accumulation in plants exhibiting excessive shoot Pi accumulation due to the overexpression of OsPHR2.
 However, the transcript level of OsPHF1 itself is not controlled by OsPHR2.
 Overexpression of OsPHF1 increased Pi accumulation in both roots and shoots in a solution culture with Pi_supplied condition.
 These results indicate that the role of OsPHF1 is unique in the localization of both low_ and high_affinity Pi transporters on the plasma membrane in rice and determines Pi uptake and translocation in rice.
 OsTRXh1 is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments.
 Intriguingly, OsTRXh1 is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level.
 The knockdown of OsTRXh1 results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of OsTRXh1 leads to a salt_sensitive phenotype in rice.
 In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of OsTRXh1 decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth.
 We also analyzed the levels of hydrogen peroxide produced in transgenic plants, and the results show that more hydrogen peroxide is produced in the extracellular space of OsTRXh1 knockdown plants than in wild_type plants, whereas the OsTRXh1 overexpression plants produce less hydrogen peroxide under salt stress.
 These results show that OsTRXh1 regulates the redox state of the apoplast and influences plant development and stress responses.
 Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high_manganese (Mn) condition.
 OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals.
 Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter_green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots.
 Heterogolous expression of OsYSL6 in yeast showed transport activity for the Mn_nicotianamine complex but not for the Mn_mugineic acid complex.
 Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn_nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice.
 Overexpression of SG1 in rice produced a phenotype with short grains and dwarfing reminiscent of brassinosteroid (BR)_deficient mutants, with wide, dark_green, and erect leaves.
 However, the endogenous BR level in the SG1 overexpressor (SG1.
 Expression of OsbZIP46 was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses.
 Overexpression of the native OsbZIP46 gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought resistance.
 The activation domain of OsbZIP46 was defined by a series of deletions, and a region (domain D) was identified as having a negative effect on the activation.
 We produced a constitutive active form of OsbZIP46 (OsbZIP46CA1) with a deletion of domain D.
 Overexpression of OsbZIP46CA1 in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses.
 Gene chip analysis of the two overexpressors (native OsbZIP46 and the constitutive active form OsbZIP46CA1) revealed that a large number of stress_related genes, many of them predicted to be downstream genes of ABF/AREBs, were activated in the OsbZIP46CA1 overexpressor but not (even down_regulated) in the OsbZIP46 overexpressor.
 OsbZIP46 can interact with homologs of SnRK2 protein kinases that phosphorylate ABFs in Arabidopsis.
 These results suggest that OsbZIP46 is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its activation.
 The stress_related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
Bacterial blight is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo).
 Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice.
 In contrast, knockout or suppression of C3H12 resulted in partially increased susceptibility to Xoo, accompanied by decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes in rice.
 C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12.
 The C3H12 protein localized in the nucleus and possessed nucleic acid_binding activity in vitro.
 Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low_affinity Pi transporter, was up_regulated in OsMYB2P_1_overexpressing plants under Pi_sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high_affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up_regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P_1 under Pi_deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P_1 may act as a Pi_dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters.
 The ysa mutant develops albino leaves before the three_leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the six_leaf stage.
 Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in ysa mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development.
 Map_based cloning revealed that YSA encodes a PPR protein with 16 tandem PPR motifs.
 YSA is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light.
 We showed that the ysa mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed_setting rate, hybrid seed_setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions.
 We further demonstrated that ysa can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha21.
 We confirmed that the rice (Oryza sativa) CslF6 gene mediates the biosynthesis of MLG by  overexpressing it in Nicotiana benthamiana.
 Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight  decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development.
 However, cslf6 mutants display a drastic decrease in MLG content (97%  reduction in coleoptiles and virtually undetectable in other tissues).
 Mutants also display lesion mimic phenotypes in leaves, which correlates with enhanced defense_related gene expression and enhanced disease resistance.
 In this study, we report the isolation of a brittle culm mutant, bc15, and the map_based cloning of the BC15/OsCTL1 (for chitinase_like1) gene affected in the mutant.
 Mutation of BC15/OsCTL1 causes reduced cellulose content and mechanical strength without obvious alterations in plant growth.
 Bioinformatic analyses indicated that BC15/OsCTL1 is a class II chitinase_like protein that is devoid of both an amino_terminal cysteine_rich domain and the chitinase activity motif H_E_T_T but possesses an amino_terminal transmembrane domain.
 Biochemical assays demonstrated that BC15/OsCTL1 is a Golgi_localized type II membrane protein that lacks classical chitinase activity.
 Quantitative real_time polymerase chain reaction and b_glucuronidase activity analyses indicated that BC15/OsCTL1 is ubiquitously expressed.
 Investigation of the global expression profile of wild_type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling.
 OsPT1 was able to complement the proton_coupled Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake.
 Transgenic plants of OsPT1 overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild_type control in Pi_sufficient shoots.
 Furthermore, OsPT1 expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that OsPT1 is involved in the OsPHO2_regulated Pi pathway.
 These results indicate that OsPT1 is a key member of the Pht1 family involved in Pi uptake and translocation in rice under Pi_replete conditions.
 In our studies with rice (Oryza sativa), cZ inhibited seminal root elongation and up_regulated cytokinin_inducible genes, and its activities were comparable to those of tZ.
 Tracer experiments showed that exogenously supplied cZ_riboside was mainly converted into cZ derivatives but scarcely into tZ derivatives, indicating that isomerizations of cZ derivatives into tZ derivatives are a minor pathway in rice cytokinin metabolism.
 Transgenic rice lines ectopically overexpressing the cZOGT1 and cZOGT2 genes exhibited short_shoot phenotypes, delay of leaf senescence, and decrease in crown root number, while cZOGT3 overexpressor lines did not show shortened shoots.
 OsMGT1 was expressed in both the roots and shoots in the absence of Al, but the expression only in the roots was rapidly up_regulated by Al.
 An investigation of subcellular localization showed that OsMGT1 was localized to the plasma membrane.
 A short_term (30 min) uptake experiment with stable isotope 25Mg showed that knockout of OsMGT1 resulted in decreased Mg uptake, but that the uptake in the wild type was enhanced by Al.
 Taken together, our results indicate that OsMGT1 is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up_regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell.
Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding and moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and grain yields.
 Although a few rolled_leaf mutants have been identified and some genes controlling leaf rolling have been isolated, the molecular mechanisms of leaf rolling still need to be elucidated.
 Here we report the isolation and characterization of SEMI_ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1), a gene involved in the regulation of leaf rolling.
 SRL1 is expressed in various tissues and is expressed at low levels in bulliform cells.
 SRL1 protein is located at the plasma membrane and predicted to be a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol_anchored protein.
 These results provide the transcript profile of rice leaf cells that will become bulliform cells and demonstrate that SRL1 regulates leaf rolling through inhibiting the formation of bulliform cells by negatively regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H+_ATPase subunits and H+_pyrophosphatase, which will help to understand the mechanism regulating leaf rolling.
The control of floral organ identity by homeotic MADS box genes is well established in eudicots.
 In this study, we characterized a MIKC_type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa).
 The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs.
 Map_based cloning demonstrated that CFO1 encoded the OsMADS32 protein.
 The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs.
 The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers.
 Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers.
 We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression.
 In this study, we found that one rice WAK_RLK gene, DEFECT IN EARLY EMBRYO SAC1 (OsDEES1), is involved in the regulation of early embryo sac development.
 OsDEES1 silencing by RNA interference caused a high rate of female sterility.
 Crossing experiments showed that female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried a functional defect.
 A detailed investigation of the ovaries from OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated that the knockdown of OsDEES1 expression did not affect megasporogenesis but that it disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting in a degenerated embryo sac and defective seed formation.
 OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue_specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings.
 In the ovary, OsDEES1 was expressed in the megagametophyte region and surrounding nucellus cells in the ovule near the micropylar region.
 OsDEES1 was found to be a membrane_localized protein with a unique sequence compared with other WAK_RLKs.
 These data indicate that OsDEES1 plays a role in rice sexual reproduction by regulating female gametophyte development.
 Expression of OsTZF1 was induced by drought, high_salt stress, and hydrogen peroxide.
 OsTZF1 gene expression was also induced by abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid.
 Histochemical activity of b_glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with b_glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues.
 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi.
Tiller angle and leaf angle are two important components of rice plant architecture that play a crucial role in determining grain yield.
 Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture 1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 5 (SGR5) gene.
 LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint.
 LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism.
 Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint.
 However, LPA1 only influences gravity perception or signal transduction in coleoptile gravitropism by regulating the sedimentation rate of amyloplasts, distinct from the actions of LAZY1.
 LPA1 encodes a plant_specific INDETERMINATE domain (IDD) protein and defines a novel subfamily of 28 IDD proteins with several unique conserved features.
 LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ERF_associated amphiphilic repression (EAR)_like motif.
 Further analysis suggests that LPA1 participates in a complicated transcriptional and protein interaction network, and has evolved novel functions distinct from SGR5.
 This study not only facilitates to the understanding of gravitropism mechanisms, but also generates a useful genetic material for rice breeding.
 Here, we report on the effects of overexpressing one of these genes, OsAt10 (LOC_Os06g39390), in rice.
 An activation_tagged line, OsAT10_D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide_bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p_CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition.
 Two additional independent OsAt10 overexpression lines show similar changes in FA and p_CA content.
 These results suggest that OsAT10 is a p_coumaroyl coenzyme A transferase involved in glucuronoarabinoxylan modification.
 Thus, OsAt10 is an attractive target for improving grass cell wall quality for fuel and animal feed.
 We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (OsGT1) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Microscopic analyses revealed that osgt1 pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains.
 In osgt1 pollen, intine structure was disrupted.
 Recombinant OsGT1 transferred glucose from UDP_glucose to the third and seventh positions of quercetin, a universal substrate of glycosyltransferases.
 Taken together, our results suggest that OsGT1 is a Golgi_localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development.
 These results suggest that the MULTI_FLORET SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet meristem determinacy and floral organ identity.
 The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains.
 Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth.
 CAP1 encodes a protein consisting of 996 amino acids that showed high similarity to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) L_arabinokinase, which catalyzes the conversion of L_arabinose to L_arabinose 1_phosphate.
 A wild_type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains.
 During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage.
 Based on the metabolic pathway of L_arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of L_arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP_L_arabinose derived from L_arabinose 1_phosphate.
 The expression pattern of CAP1 was very similar to that of another Arabidopsis homolog that showed 71% amino acid identity with CAP1.
 Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.
 Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering.
 Coexpression, microarray, and real_time expression analyses demonstrate a correlation between Cga1 expression and the expression of important nucleus_encoded, chloroplast_localized genes.
 Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling.
 Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index.
 These results indicate a conserved mechanism by which Cga1 regulates chloroplast development in higher plants.
 Overexpression of RePRP in transgenic rice reduces root cell elongation in the absence of ABA, similar to the effect of ABA on wild_type roots.
 Conversely, simultaneous knockdown of the expression of RePRP1 and RePRP2 reduces the root sensitivity to ABA, indicating that RePRP proteins play an essential role in ABA/stress regulation of root growth and development.
 It is suggested that RePRP1 and RePRP2 are functionally redundant suppressors of root cell expansion and probably act through interactions with cell wall components near the plasma membrane.
 The young chlorotic leaves turn green in later developmental stages, accompanied by alterations in chlorophyll accumulation, chloroplast ultrastructure, and the expression of chloroplast development_ and photosynthesis_related genes.
 Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast.
 VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development.
 The mutation in vyl causes premature termination of the predicted gene product and loss of the conserved catalytic triad (serine_histidine_aspartate) and the polypeptide_binding site of VYL.
 In addition, yeast two_hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4.
 Map_base cloning studies showed that glup6 was a loss_offunction mutant of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates Rab GTPase, a key regulator of membrane trafficking.
 Immunofluorescence studies showed that the transport of proglutelins and a_globulins to PSV was disrupted in glup6 endosperm.
 Secreted granules of glutelin and a_globulin were readily observed in young glup6 endosperm, followed by the formation of large dilated paramural bodies (PMBs) containing both proteins as the endosperm matures.
 The PMBs also contained membrane biomarkers for the Golgi and prevacuolar compartment as well as the cell wall component, b_glucan.
 Overall, our results indicate that GLUP6/GEF is the activator of Rab5 GTPase and that the cycling of GTP_ and GDP_bound forms of this regulatory protein is essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin and a_globulin from the Golgi to PSVs and in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in rice seeds.
 During the rice responses to drought stress and bacterial infection, WRKY13 selectively bound to certain site_ and sequence_specific cis_elements on the promoters of SNAC1 (for STRESS RESPONSIVE NO APICAL MERISTEM, ARABIDOPSIS TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION FACTOR1/2, CUP_SHAPED COTYLEDON), the overexpression of which increases drought resistance, and WRKY45_1, the knockout of which increases both bacterial disease and drought resistance.
 WRKY13 was induced in leaf vascular tissue, where bacteria proliferate, during infection, and in guard cells, where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 enhances drought resistance, during both bacterial infection and drought stress.
 These results suggest that WRKY13 regulates the antagonistic cross talk between drought and disease resistance pathways by directly suppressing SNAC1 and WRKY45_1 and autoregulating its own expression via site_ and sequence_specific cis_elements on the promoters of these genes in vascular tissue where bacteria proliferate and guard cells where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 mediates drought resistance by promoting stomatal closure.
 Here, we report the function and role of an uncharacterized member of HMA, OsHMA5 in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Knockout of OsHMA5 resulted in a decreased copper (Cu) concentration in the shoots but an increased Cu concentration in the roots at the vegetative stage.
 OsHMA5 was mainly expressed in the roots at the vegetative stage but also in nodes, peduncle, rachis, and husk at the reproductive stage.
 Analysis of the transgenic rice carrying the OsHMA5 promoter fused with green fluorescent protein revealed that it was localized at the root pericycle cells and xylem region of diffuse vascular bundles in node I, vascular tissues of peduncle, rachis, and husk.
 Furthermore, immunostaining with an antibody against OsHMA5 revealed that it was localized to the plasma membrane.
 Expression of OsHMA5 in a Cu transport_defective mutant yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain restored the growth.
 Taken together, OsHMA5 is involved in loading Cu to the xylem of the roots and other organs.
 In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Arabidopsis Trithorax protein1 (ATX1) regulates flowering time and floral organ identity.
 Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Among them, the OsMADS50 and Heading date1 pathways were not affected by the mutation.
 However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1.
 Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of Ghd7, were unchanged in the mutant.
 Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7.
 We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains.
 Finally, we showed that the SET domain at the C_terminal end of OsTrx1 has histone H3 methyltransferase activity when incubated with oligonucleosomes.
 Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure.
 Here, we report the molecular mechanism underlying heat acclimation memory that confers long_term acquired thermotolerance (LAT) in this monocot plant.
 The interplay between HSP101 and HSA32 also affects basal thermotolerance of rice seeds.
 The HSP101 and HSA32 protein levels were substantially higher in Nipponbare than in N22 after a long recovery following heat acclimation treatment, at least partly explaining the difference in the LAT phenotype.
The OsCPK4 gene is a member of the complex gene family of calcium_dependent protein kinases in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Here, we report that OsCPK4 expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid.
 Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK4 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein_tagged OsCPK4 in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells.
 Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress.
 Compared with control plants, OsCPK4 overexpressor plants exhibit stronger water_holding capability and reduced levels of membrane lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage under drought or salt stress conditions.
 Also, salt_treated OsCPK4 seedlings accumulate less Na+ in their roots.
 We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 and found that overexpression of OsCPK4 has a low impact on the rice transcriptome.
 Moreover, no genes were found to be commonly regulated by OsCPK4 in roots and leaves of rice plants.
 A significant number of genes involved in lipid metabolism and protection against oxidative stress appear to be up_regulated by OsCPK4 in roots of overexpressor plants.
 Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well_characterized abiotic stress_associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i.
 Taken together, our data show that OsCPK4 functions as a positive regulator of the salt and drought stress responses in rice via the protection of cellular membranes from stress_induced oxidative damage.
 Initiation of endosperm cellularization is a critical developmental transition required for normal seed development, and it is controlled by Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
 Seeds from plants overexpressing OsFIE1 had reduced seed size and exhibited precocious cellularization.
 The DNA methylation status and a repressive histone modification of OsFIE1 were observed to be temperature sensitive.
 Our data suggested that the thermal sensitivity of seed enlargement could partly be caused by altered epigenetic regulation of endosperm development during the transition from the syncytial to the cellularized state.
 In this study, two rice authentic HPs (OsAHP1 and OsAHP2) were knocked down simultaneously via RNA interference (RNAi), and the transgenic OsAHP_RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes expected for a deficiency in cytokinin signaling, including dwarfism with reduced internode lengths, enhanced lateral root growth, early leaf senescence, and reduced tiller numbers and fertility under natural conditions.
 These results indicate that OsAHPs function as positive regulators of the cytokinin signaling pathway and play different roles in salt and drought tolerance in rice.
Rice (Oryza sativa L, plants with decreased ribulose_l,5_ bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) were obtained, by transformation with the rice rbcS antisense gene under the control of the rice r6cS promoter.
 lhe primary transformants were screened for the Rubisco to leaf N ratio, and the transformant with 65% wild_type Rubisco was selected as a plant set with optimal Rubisco content at saturating CO, partial pressures for photosynthesis under conditions of high irradiance and 25°C.
 This optimal Rubisco content was estimated from the amounts and kinetic constants of Rubisco and the gas_exchange data.
 Rubisco content in the R, population was distributed into two groups.
Inflorescence and spikelet development determine grain yields in cereals.
 Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) microRNA396d (OsmiR396d) and its Os Growth Regulating Factor (OsGRF) targets, together with Os Growth Regulating Factor_Interacting Factor1 (OsGIF1), are involved in the regulation of floral organ development through the rice JMJD2 family jmjC gene 706 (OsJMJ706) and crinkly4 receptor_like kinase (OsCR4).
 Transgenic knockdown lines of OsGRF6, a predicted target of OsmiR396d, and overexpression lines of OsmiR396d showed similar defects in floral organ development, including open husks, long sterile lemmas, and altered floral organ morphology.
 OsGRF6 and its ortholog OsGRF10 were the most highly expressed OsGRF family members in young inflorescences, and the grf6/grf10 double mutant displayed abnormal florets.
 OsGRF6/OsGRF10 localized to the nucleus, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 bind the GA response element in the promoters of OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, which were reported to participate in the regulation of floral organ development.
 In addition, OsGRF6 and OsGRF10 could transactivate OsJMJ706 and OsCR4, an activity that was enhanced in the presence of OsGIF1, which can bind both OsGRF6 and OsGRF10.
 Together, our results suggest that OsmiR396d regulates the expression of OsGRF genes, which function with OsGIF1 in floret development through targeting of JMJ706 and OsCR4.
 This work thus reveals a microRNA_mediated regulation module for controlling spikelet development in rice.
 OsMAGO1, OsMAGO2 and OsY14a were constitutively expressed in all tissues while OsY14b was predominantly expressed in embryonic tissues.
 OsMAGO2 and OsY14b were more sensitive to different stresses than OsMAGO1 and OsY14a, and their encoded protein pair shared 93.
 Single MAGO downregulation in rice did not lead to any phenotypic variation; however, double_gene knockdowns generated short rice plants with abnormal flowers, and the stamens of these flowers showed inhibited degradation and absorption of both endothecium and tapetum, suggesting that OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2 were functionally redundant.
 OsY14a knockdowns phenocopied OsMAGO1OsMAGO2 mutants while downregulation of OsY14b failed to induce plantlets, suggesting the functional specialization of OsY14b in embryogenesis.
 Concomitantly, MAGO and Y14 selectively bound to the OsUDT1 pre_mRNA, suggesting that rice EJC subunits regulate splicing.
Crown roots constitute the majority of the rice (Oryza sativa) root system and play an important role in rice growth and development.
 However, the molecular mechanism of crown root formation in rice is not well understood.
 Here, we characterized a rice dominant mutant, root enhancer1 (ren1_D), which was observed to exhibit a more robust root system, increased crown root number, and reduced plant height.
 Subcellular localization demonstrated that OsCKX4 is a cytosolic isoform of CKX.
 OsCKX4 is predominantly expressed in leaf blades and roots.
 It is the dominant CKX, preferentially expressed in the shoot base where crown root primordia are produced, underlining its role in root initiation.
 OsCKX4 is induced by exogenous auxin and cytokinin in the roots.
 Furthermore, one_hybrid assays revealed that OsCKX4 is a direct binding target of both the auxin response factor OsARF25 and the cytokinin response regulators OsRR2 and OsRR3.
 Overexpression and RNA interference of OsCKX4 confirmed that OsCKX4 plays a positive role in crown root formation.
 Moreover, expression analysis revealed a significant alteration in the expression of auxin_related genes in the ren1_D mutants, indicating that the OsCKX4 mediates crown root development by integrating the interaction between cytokinin and auxin.
 Transgenic plants harboring OsCKX4 under the control of the root_specific promoter RCc3 displayed enhanced root development without affecting their shoot parts, suggesting that this strategy could be a powerful tool in rice root engineering.
 In recombinant enzyme assays, CYP93G1 desaturated naringenin and eriodictyol to apigenin and luteolin, respectively.
 Consistently, transgenic expression of CYP93G1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in the accumulation of different flavone O_glycosides, which are not naturally present in cruciferous plants.
 Metabolite analysis of a rice CYP93G1 insertion mutant further demonstrated the preferential depletion of tricin O_linked flavanolignans and glycosides.
 Our findings established that CYP93G1 is a key branch point enzyme channeling flavanones to the biosynthesis of tricin O_linked conjugates in rice.
 We introduced a chimeric gene encoding an antisense RNA of NDP kinase under the control of the Arabidopsis heat shock protein HSP81_1 promoter into rice (Oryza sativa L, plants using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation system.
 Following heat shock treatment (37°C), NDP kinase activities in some transgenic rice plants were more reduced than those grown under 25°C.
 The comparison of the coleoptile growth under submersion showed that cell elongation process was inhibited in antisense NDP kinase transgenic plants, suggesting that an altered guanine nucleotide level may be responsible for the processes.
 OsMAPK5 is a single_copy gene but can generate at least two differentially spliced transcripts.
 The OsMAPK5 gene, its protein, and kinase activity were inducible by abscisic acid as well as various biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (wounding, drought, salt, and cold) stresses.
 Interestingly, suppression of OsMAPK5 expression and its kinase activity resulted in the constitutive expression of pathogenesis_related (PR) genes such as PR1 and PR10 in the dsRNAi transgenic plants and significantly enhanced resistance to fungal (Magnaporthe grisea) and bacterial (Burkholderia glumae) pathogens.
 However, these same dsRNAi lines had significant reductions in drought, salt, and cold tolerance.
 By contrast, overexpression lines exhibited increased OsMAPK5 kinase activity and increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses.
 These results strongly suggest that OsMAPK5 can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance and negatively modulate PR gene expression and broad_spectrum disease resistance.
 Antisense SPK transformants lacked the ability to accumulate storage products such as starch, but produced watery seed with a large amount of Suc instead, as the result of an inhibition of Suc degradation.
 Analysis of in vitro phosphorylation indicated that SPK phosphorylated specifically a Ser residue in Suc synthase that has been shown to be important for its activity in the degradation of Suc.
 This finding suggests that SPK is involved in the activation of Suc synthase.
 It appears that SPK is a Suc synthase kinase that may be important for supplying substrates for the biosynthesis of storage products.
 In adult plants with constitutive OsEXP4 expression, 12% of overexpressors were taller and 88% were shorter than the average control plants, and most overexpressors developed at least two additional leaves.
 In transgenic plants with inducible OsEXP4 expression, we observed a close correlation between OsEXP4 protein levels and seedling growth.
 The change in seedling growth resulted from corresponding changes in cell size, which in turn appeared to be a function of altered cell wall extensibility.
The function of the novel gene MSP1 (MULTIPLE SPOROCYTE), which controls early sporogenic development, was elucidated by characterizing a retrotransposon_tagged mutation of rice.
 The MSP1 gene encoded a Leu_rich repeat receptor– like protein kinase.
 The msp1 mutation gave rise to an excessive number of both male and female sporocytes.
 Although the mutation never affected homologous chromosome pairing and chiasma maintenance, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at various stages of meiotic prophase I, which resulted in complete male sterility.
 In situ expression of MSP1 was detected in surrounding cells of male and female sporocytes and some flower tissues, but never in the sporocytes themselves.
 These results suggest that the MSP1 product plays crucial roles in restricting the number of cells entering into male and female sporogenesis and in initiating anther wall formation in rice.
 The dwarf phenotype of d2 was rescued by exogenous brassinolide treatment.
 The accumulation profile of BR intermediates in the d2 mutants confirmed that these plants are deficient in late BR biosynthesis.
 We cloned the D2 gene by map_based cloning.
 The D2 gene encoded a novel cytochrome P450 classified in CYP90D that is highly similar to the reported BR synthesis enzymes.
 Introduction of the wild D2 gene into d2_1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants.
 In feeding experiments, 3_dehydro_6_deoxoteasterone, 3_dehydroteasterone, and brassinolide effectively caused the lamina joints of the d2 plants to bend, whereas more upstream compounds did not cause bending.
 However, the role of GAMYB elsewhere in the plant is not well understood.
 To investigate the molecular function of GAMYB outside of the aleurone cells, we isolated loss_of_function mutants from a panel of rice mutants produced by the insertion of a retrotransposon, Tos17.
 Through PCR screening using primers for rice GAMYB (OsGAMYB) and Tos17, we isolated three independent mutant alleles that contained Tos17 inserted in the exon region.
 After the phase transition to the reproductive stage, however, shortened internodes and defects in floral organ development, especially a defect in pollen development, were observed.
 On the other hand, no difference was detected in flowering time.
 These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of α_amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development.
In this article, we report that carpel specification in the Oryza sativa (rice) flower is regulated by the floral homeotic gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) that is distinct from the well_known ABC genes.
 Severe loss_of_function mutations of DL cause complete homeotic transformation of carpels into stamens.
 Molecular cloning reveals that DL is a member of the YABBY gene family and is closely related to the CRABS CLAW (CRC) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana.
 DL is expressed in the presumptive region (carpel anlagen), where carpel primordia would initiate, and in carpel primordia.
 These results suggest that carpel specification is regulated by DL in rice flower development.
 Whereas CRC plays only a partial role in carpel identity, DL may have been recruited to have the more essential function of specifying carpels during the evolution of rice.
 We also show that DL interacts antagonistically with class B genes and controls floral meristem determinacy.
 In addition, severe and weak dl alleles fail to form a midrib in the leaf.
 The phenotypic analysis of dl mutants, together with analyses of the spatial expression patterns and ectopic expression of DL, demonstrate that DL regulates midrib formation by promoting cell proliferation in the central region of the rice leaf.
We have identified and characterized a novel gene, PAIR1 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1), required for homologous chromosome pairing and cytokinesis in male and female meiocytes of rice (Oryza sativa).
 The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis_specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes.
 The PAIR1 gene encodes a 492–amino acid protein, which contains putative coiled_coil motifs in the middle, two basic regions at both termini, and a potential nuclear localization signal at the C terminus.
 Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis.
 During prophase I of the pair1 meiocyte, all the chromosomes became entangled to form a compact sphere adhered to a nucleolus, and homologous pairing failed.
 However, chromosomal fragmentation frequent in plant meiotic mutants was never observed in all of the pair1 meiocytes.
 These observations clarify that the PAIR1 protein plays an essential role in establishment of homologous chromosome pairing in rice meiosis.
 To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the D11 gene was isolated by a map_based cloning method.
 The dwarf phenotype of d11 mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL).
 Compared with wild_type plants, the aberrant D11 mRNA accumulated at higher levels in d11 mutants and was dramatically reduced by treatment with BL, implying that the gene is feedback_regulated by BL.
 Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants.
 However, 6_deoxotyphasterol (6_DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d11 mutants in a lamina joint bending assay.
The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate–mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens.
 Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map_based cloning strategy.
 The isolation of the Spl11 gene was facilitated by the identification of three additional spl11 alleles from an IR64 mutant collection.
 The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U_box domain and an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein–protein interactions, respectively.
 Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U_box_ARM proteins is mostly restricted to the U_box and ARM repeat regions.
 A single base substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop codon in the SPL11 protein.
 Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice–blast interactions.
 In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U_box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense.
 Phylogenetic analysis of putative CPT1 homologs of rice and related proteins indicated that CPT1 has an orthologous relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana NPH3.
 In an extended study with the cpt1 mutant, it was found that phototropic differential growth is accompanied by a CPT1_independent inhibition of net growth.
 Kinetic investigation further indicated that a small phototropism occurs in cpt1 coleoptiles.
 This response, induced only transiently, was thought to be caused by the CPT1_independent growth inhibition.
 However, no asymmetry was induced in cpt1 coleoptiles, indicating that lateral translocation of auxin occurs downstream of CPT1.
 It is concluded that the CPT1_dependent major phototropism of coleoptiles is achieved by lateral auxin translocation and subsequent growth redistribution.
 The brd2 locus contains a single base deletion in the coding region of Dim/dwf1, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana DIMINUTO/DWARF1 (DIM/DWF1).
 Introduction of the wild_type Dim/dwf1 gene into brd2 restored the normal phenotype.
 Overproduction and repression of Dim/dwf1 resulted in contrasting phenotypes, with repressors mimicking the brd2 phenotype and over_producers having large stature with increased numbers of flowers and seeds.
 Although brd2 contains low levels of common 6_oxo_type BRs, the severity of the brd2 phenotype is much milder than brd1 mutants and most similar to d2 and d11, which show a semidwarf phenotype at the young seedling stage.
 DS enhances the rice lamina joint bending angle, rescues the brd1 dwarf phenotype, and inhibits root elongation, indicating that DS is a bioactive BR in rice.
Although the importance of auxin in root development is well known, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown.
 We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in crown root formation, crown rootless1 (crl1).
 The crl1 mutant showed additional auxin_related abnormal phenotypic traits in the roots, such as decreased lateral root number, auxin insensitivity in lateral root formation, and impaired root gravitropism, whereas no abnormal phenotypic traits were observed in aboveground organs.
 Exogenous auxin treatment induced Crl1 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, and this induction required the degradation of AUXIN/INDOLE_3_ACETIC ACID proteins.
 Crl1 contains two putative auxin response elements (AuxREs) in its promoter region.
 The proximal AuxRE specifically interacted with a rice AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and acted as a cis_motif for Crl1 expression.
 We conclude that Crl1 encodes a positive regulator for crown and lateral root formation and that its expression is directly regulated by an ARF in the auxin signaling pathway.
We have isolated phytochrome B (phyB) and phyC mutants from rice (Oryza sativa) and have produced all combinations of double mutants.
 Seedlings of phyB and phyB phyC mutants exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity to continuous red light (Rc) but still showed significant deetiolation responses.
 The responses to Rc were completely canceled in phyA phyB double mutants.
 These results indicate that phyA and phyB act in a highly redundant manner to control deetiolation under Rc.
 Under continuous far_red light (FRc), phyA mutants showed partially impaired deetiolation, and phyA phyC double mutants showed no significant residual phytochrome responses, indicating that not only phyA but also phyC is involved in the photoperception of FRc in rice.
 Interestingly, the phyB phyC double mutant displayed clear R/FR reversibility in the pulse irradiation experiments, indicating that both phyA and phyB can mediate the low_fluence response for gene expression.
 Rice is a short_day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long_day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time.
 The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
 The results showed that plant_specific RSp29 and RSZp23, an SR protein homologous to human 9G8, enhanced splicing and altered the alternative 59 splice sites of Wxb intron 1.
 The resulting splicing pattern was unique to each SR protein; RSp29 stimulated splicing at the distal site, and RSZp23 enhanced splicing at the proximal site.
 Results of domain_swapping experiments between plant_specific RSp29 and SCL26, which is a homolog of human SC35, showed the importance of RNA recognition motif 1 and the Arg/Ser_rich (RS) domain for the enhancement of splicing efficiencies.
 Although the pattern of leaf initiation is a key element of plant shoot architecture, little is known about how the time interval between initiation events, termed plastochron, is regulated.
 Here, we present a detailed analysis of plastochron2 (pla2), a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron and precocious maturation of leaves during the vegetative phase and ectopic shoot formation during the reproductive phase.
 The corresponding PLA2 gene is revealed to be an orthologue of terminal ear1, a maize (Zea mays) gene that encodes a MEI2_like RNA binding protein.
 PLA2 is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia.
 We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family.
 Based on these analyses, we propose a model in which plastochron is determined by signals from immature leaves that act non_cell_autonomously in the shoot apical meristem to inhibit the initiation of new leaves.
1, is essential for the maintenance of cell division and individual cell survival in the root apical meristem at the early seedling stage.
 Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that SnRK1A and SnRK1B act upstream and relieve glucose repression of MYBS1 and aAmy3 SRC promoters.
 The accumulation and activity of SnRK1A was regulated by sugars posttranscriptionally, and SnRK1A relieved glucose repression specifically through the TA box in SRC.
 A transgenic RNA interference approach indicated that SnRK1A is also necessary for the activation of MYBS1 and aAmy3 expression under glucose starvation.
 Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied.
 Our studies demonstrated that SnRK1A is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and aAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice.
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and nucleus_controlled fertility restoration are widespread plant reproductive features that provide useful tools to exploit heterosis in crops.
 Expression of orf79 in CMS lines and transgenic rice plants caused gametophytic male sterility.
 Two fertility restorer genes, Rf1a and Rf1b, were identified at the classical locus Rf_1 as members of a multigene cluster that encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins.
 RF1A and RF1B are both targeted to mitochondria and can restore male fertility by blocking ORF79 production via endonucleolytic cleavage (RF1A) or degradation (RF1B) of dicistronic B_atp6/orf79 mRNA.
 In the presence of both restorers, RF1A was epistatic over RF1B in the mRNA processing.
 We have also shown that RF1A plays an additional role in promoting the editing of atp6 mRNAs, independent of its cleavage function.
Rc is a domestication_related gene required for red pericarp in rice (Oryza sativa).
 sativa, in which it is closely associated with seed shattering and dormancy.
 Rc encodes a basic helix_loop_helix (bHLH) protein that was fine_mapped to an 18.
5_kb region on rice chromosome 7 using a cross between Oryza rufipogon (red pericarp) and O.
 Sequencing of the alleles from both mapping parents as well as from two independent genetic stocks of Rc revealed that the dominant red allele differed from the recessive white allele by a 14_bp deletion within exon 6 that knocked out the bHLH domain of the protein.
 A premature stop codon was identified in the second mutant stock that had a light red pericarp.
 RT_PCR experiments confirmed that the Rc gene was expressed in both red_ and white_grained rice but that a shortened transcript was present in white varieties.
The recessive tall rice (Oryza sativa) mutant elongated uppermost internode (eui) is morphologically normal until its final internode elongates drastically at the heading stage.
 The stage_specific developmental effect of the eui mutation has been used in the breeding of hybrid rice to improve the performance of heading in male sterile cultivars.
 We found that the eui mutant accumulated exceptionally large amounts of biologically active gibberellins (GAs) in the uppermost internode.
 Map_based cloning revealed that the Eui gene encodes a previously uncharacterized cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, CYP714D1.
 Using heterologous expression in yeast, we found that EUI catalyzed 16a,17_epoxidation of non_13_hydroxylated GAs.
 Consistent with the tall and dwarfed phenotypes of the eui mutant and Eui_overexpressing transgenic plants, respectively, 16a,17_epoxidation reduced the biological activity of GA4 in rice, demonstrating that EUI functions as a GA_deactivating enzyme.
 Expression of Eui appeared tightly regulated during plant development, in agreement with the stage_specific eui phenotypes.
 These results indicate the existence of an unrecognized pathway for GA deactivation by EUI during the growth of wild_type internodes.
 The identification of Eui as a GA catabolism gene provides additional evidence that the GA metabolism pathway is a useful target for increasing the agronomic value of crops.
 Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed that epicuticular wax crystals were absent in the outer layer of the anther and that microspore development was severely retarded and finally disrupted as a result of defective pollen exine formation in the mutant anthers.
 These biochemical and developmental defects in tapetum found in wda1 mutants are earlier events than those in other male_sterile mutants, which showed defects of lipidic molecules in exine.
Chlorophyll degradation is an aspect of leaf senescence, which is an active process to salvage nutrients from old tissues.
 non_yellow coloring1 (nyc1) is a rice (Oryza sativa) stay_green mutant in which chlorophyll degradation during senescence is impaired.
 Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes.
 Map_based cloning of NYC1 revealed that it encodes a chloroplast_localized short_chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains.
 The predicted structure of the NYC1 protein and the phenotype of the nyc1 mutant suggest the possibility that NYC1 is a chlorophyll b reductase.
 Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1_like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro.
 We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions.
 Our data collectively suggest that the identified SDR protein NYC1 plays essential roles in the regulation of LHCII and thylakoid membrane degradation during senescence.
 The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains two homologous UGPase genes, Ugp1 and Ugp2.
 We report a functional characterization of rice Ugp1, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development.
 Ugp1 silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility.
 Expressing a double_stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1_RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development.
 These aberrant transcripts undergo temperature_sensitive splicing in florets, leading to a novel thermosensitive genic male sterility.
 Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Ugp1_silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted.
 Consequently, the PMCs began to degenerate at the early meiosis stage, eventually resulting in complete pollen collapse.
 These results demonstrate that rice Ugp1 is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development.
Loss of green color in leaves results from chlorophyll (Chl) degradation in chloroplasts, but little is known about how Chl catabolism is regulated throughout leaf development.
 Using the staygreen (sgr) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which maintains greenness during leaf senescence, we identified Sgr, a senescence_associated gene encoding a novel chloroplast protein.
 Transgenic rice overexpressing Sgr produces yellowish_brown leaves, and Arabidopsis thaliana pheophorbide a oxygenase–impaired mutants exhibiting a stay_green phenotype during dark_induced senescence have reduced expression of Sgr homologs, indicating that Sgr regulates Chl degradation at the transcriptional level.
 We show that the leaf stay_greenness of the sgr mutant is associated with a failure in the destabilization of the light_harvesting chlorophyll binding protein (LHCP) complexes of the thylakoid membranes, which is a prerequisite event for the degradation of Chls and LHCPs during senescence.
 Transient overexpression of Sgr in Nicotiana benthamiana and an in vivo pull_down assay show that Sgr interacts with LHCPII, indicating that the Sgr_LHCPII complexes are formed in the thylakoid membranes.
 Thus, we propose that in senescing leaves, Sgr regulates Chl degradation by inducing LHCPII disassembly through direct interaction, leading to the degradation of Chls and Chl_free LHCPII by catabolic enzymes and proteases, respectively.
 RNA interference–mediated knockdown of WRKY45 compromised BTH_inducible resistance to blast disease, indicating that it is essential for BTH_induced defense responses.
 In a transient expression system, WRKY45 activated reporter gene transcription through W_boxes.
 Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY45 acts in the SA signaling pathway independently of NH1, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1, which distinguishes WRKY45 from known Arabidopsis WRKY TFs.
 Defense gene expression in WRKY45_overexpressed rice plants varied with growth conditions, suggesting that some environmental factor(s) acts downstream of WRKY45 transcription.
 We propose a role for WRKY45 in BTH_induced and SA_mediated defense signaling in rice and its potential utility in improving disease resistance of rice, an importance food resource worldwide.
XA21 is a receptor_like kinase protein in rice (Oryza sativa) that confers gene_for_gene resistance to specific races of the causal agent of bacterial blight disease, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae.
 We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase.
 The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays.
 XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively.
 Transgenic plants with reduced expression of the Xb3 gene are compromised in resistance to the avirulent race of X.
 oryzae pv oryzae.
 Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein.
 These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21_mediated resistance.
Although the role of H3K9 methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) is unclear, in Arabidopsis thaliana the loss of histone H3K9 methylation by mutation of Kryptonite [also known as SU(VAR)3_9 homolog] reduces genome_wide DNA methylation and increases the transcription of transposable elements.
 Here, we report that rice SDG714 (for SET Domain Group Protein714) encodes a histone H3K9_specific methyltransferase.
 The C terminus of SDG714 confers enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, whereas the N terminus localizes it in the nucleus.
 Loss_of_function mutants of SDG714 (SDG714IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants.
 Most interestingly, loss of function of SDG714 can enhance transcription and cause the transposition of Tos17.
 Together, these results suggest that histone H3K9 methylation mediated by SDG714 is involved in DNA methylation, the transposition of transposable elements, and genome stability in rice.
 Both knockout and antisense mutants of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN1 (RTBP1) exhibited markedly longer telomeres relative to those of the wild type, indicating that the amount of functional RTBP1 is inversely correlated with telomere length.
 rtbp1 plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4).
 Reproductive organ formation, including panicles, stamens, and spikelets, was also gradually and severely impaired in G1 to G4 mutants.
 From mutant stocks induced by N_methyl_N_nitrosourea treatment, we identified plants with mutations in the Pho1 gene that are deficient in Pho1.
 The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure.
 The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent.
 These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures.
 Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1.
 Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
 RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin.
 Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection.
 Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings.
 RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance.
 These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex.
 To understand these differences in transmission, we examined the effect of GA on microsporogenesis and pollen tube elongation in rice using new GAdeficient and GA_insensitive mutants that produce semifertile flowers.
 Phenotypic analysis revealed that the GA_deficient mutant reduced pollen elongation1 is defective in pollen tube elongation, resulting in a low fertilization frequency, whereas the GA_insensitive semidominant mutant Slr1_d3 is mainly defective in viable pollen production.
 Quantitative RT_PCR revealed that GA_biosynthesis genes tested whose mutations are transmitted to the next generation at a lower frequency are preferentially expressed after meiosis during pollen development, but expression is absent or very low before the meiosis stage, whereas GA signal_related genes are actively expressed before meiosis.
 Based on these observations, we predict that the transmission of GA_signaling genes occurs in a sporophytic manner, since the protein products and/or mRNA transcripts of these genes may be introduced into pollen_carrying mutant alleles, whereas GA synthesis genes are transmitted in a gametophytic manner, since these genes are preferentially expressed after meiosis.
 RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene–mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species.
 Os RAR1_RNA interference (RNAi) rice plants had impaired basal resistance to a compatible race of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the virulent bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae.
 Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked.
 Studies with Os RAR1_RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90_specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1_mediated enhancement of pathogen_associated molecular pattern–triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures.
 Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.
 GH3_8 encodes an IAA–amino synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation.
 Overexpression of GH3_8 results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae.
 Overexpression of GH3_8 also causes abnormal plant morphology and retarded growth and development.
The rice (Oryza sativa) E3 ligase SPOTTED LEAF11 (SPL11) negatively regulates programmed cell death and disease resistance.
 We demonstrate here that SPL11 also regulates flowering via interaction with SPIN1 (for SPL11_interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member.
 SPIN1 binds RNA and DNA in vitro and interacts with SPL11 in the nucleus.
 Spl11 mutants have delayed flowering under long_day conditions.
 Spin1 overexpression causes late flowering independently of daylength; expression analyses of flowering marker genes in these lines suggested that SPIN1 represses flowering by downregulating the flowering promoter gene Heading date3a (Hd3a) via Hd1_dependent mechanisms in short days and by targeting Hd1_independent factors in long days.
 Both Spin1 and Spl11 are regulated diurnally in opposing phases.
 SPL11 negatively regulates Spin1 transcript levels, while SPIN1 also affects Spl11 expression.
 SPIN1 is monoubiquitinated by SPL11, suggesting that it is not targeted for degradation.
 Our data are consistent with a model in which SPIN1 acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by SPL11, possibly via ubiquitination.
In rice (Oryza sativa), the presence of a dominant Badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) inhibits the synthesis of 2_acetyl_1_pyrroline (2AP), a potent flavor component in rice fragrance.
 Badh2 was found to be transcribed in all tissues tested except for roots, and the transcript was detected at higher abundance in young, healthy leaves than in other tissues.
 Multiple Badh2 transcript lengths were detected, and the complete, full_length Badh2 transcript was much less abundant than partial Badh2 transcripts.
 2AP levels were significantly reduced in cauliflower mosaic virus 35S_driven transgenic lines expressing the complete, but not the partial, Badh2 coding sequences.
 In accordance, the intact, full_length BADH2 protein (503 residues) appeared exclusively in nonfragrant transgenic lines and rice varieties.
 These results indicate that the full_length BADH2 protein encoded by Badh2 renders rice nonfragrant by inhibiting 2AP biosynthesis.
 The BADH2 enzyme was predicted to contain three domains.
 Lsi6 belongs to the nodulin_26 intrinsic protein III subgroup of aquaporins and is permeable to silicic acid.
 Lsi6 is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips.
 Cellular localization studies revealed that Lsi6 is found in the xylem parenchyma cells of the leaf sheath and leaf blades.
 Moreover, Lsi6 showed polar localization at the side facing toward the vessel.
 Knockdown of Lsi6 did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid.
 These results indicate that Lsi6 is a transporter responsible for the transport of Si out of the xylem and subsequently affects the distribution of Si in the leaf.
As an important agronomic trait, rice (Oryza sativa L, leaf rolling has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders.
 Moderate leaf rolling increases the photosynthesis of cultivars and hence raises grain yield.
 Here, we show the isolation and functional characterization of SHALLOT_LIKE1 (SLL1), a key gene controlling rice leaf rolling.
 sll1 mutant plants have extremely incurved leaves due to the defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side.
 SLL1 is transcribed in various tissues and accumulates in the abaxial epidermis throughout leaf development.
 SLL1 encodes a SHAQKYF class MYB family transcription factor belonging to the KANADI family.
 SLL1 deficiency leads to defective programmed cell death of abaxial mesophyll cells and suppresses the development of abaxial features.
 By contrast, enhanced SLL1 expression stimulates phloem development on the abaxial side and suppresses bulliform cell and sclerenchyma development on the adaxial side.
 Additionally, SLL1 deficiency results in increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis.
 Our findings identify the role of SLL1 in the modulation of leaf abaxial cell development and in sustaining abaxial characteristics during leaf development.
 These results should facilitate attempts to use molecular breeding to increase the photosynthetic capacity of rice, as well as other crops, by modulating leaf development and rolling.
In rice (Oryza sativa), the shoot_borne crown roots are the major root type and are initiated at lower stem nodes as part of normal plant development.
 However, the regulatory mechanism of crown root development is poorly understood.
 In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL_related Homeobox (WOX) gene, WOX11, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth.
 WOX11 was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem.
 Loss_of_function mutation or down_regulation of the gene reduced the number and the growth rate of crown roots, whereas overexpression of the gene induced precocious crown root growth and dramatically increased the root biomass by producing crown roots at the upper stem nodes and the base of florets.
 The expressions of auxin_ and cytokinin_responsive genes were affected in WOX11 overexpression and RNA interference transgenic plants.
 Further analysis showed that WOX11 directly repressed RR2, a type_A cytokinin_responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia.
 The results suggest that WOX11 may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development.
Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating reproductive development, especially anther development.
 Our previous studies revealed that the MYB transcriptional factor GAMYB, an important component of GA signaling in cereal aleurone cells, is also important for anther development.
 Here, we examined the physiological functions of GA during anther development through phenotypic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) GA_deficient, GA_insensitive, and gamyb mutants.
 Microarray analysis using anther RNAs of these mutants revealed that rice GAMYB is involved in almost all instances of GA_regulated gene expression in anthers.
 Among the GA_regulated genes, we focused on two lipid metabolic genes, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase CYP703A3 and b_ketoacyl reductase, both of which might be involved in providing a substrate for exine and Ubisch body.
 GAMYB specifically interacted with GAMYB binding motifs in the promoter regions in vitro, and mutation of these motifs in promoter_b_glucuronidase (GUS) transformants caused reduced GUS expression in anthers.
 Furthermore, a knockout mutant for CYP703A3 showed gamyb_like defects in exine and Ubisch body formation.
 Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation.
 Here, we report that two genes, STAR1 (for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1) and STAR2, are responsible for Al tolerance in rice.
 STAR1 encodes a nucleotide binding domain, while STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain, of a bacterial_type ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter.
 Both STAR1 and STAR2 are expressed mainly in the roots and are specifically induced by Al exposure.
 Expression in onion epidermal cells, rice protoplasts, and yeast showed that STAR1 interacts with STAR2 to form a complex that localizes to the vesicle membranes of all root cells, except for those in the epidermal layer of the mature zone.
 Furthermore, addition of exogenous UDP_glucose rescued root growth in the star1 mutant exposed to Al.
 These results indicate that STAR1 and STAR2 form a complex that functions as an ABC transporter, which is required for detoxification of Al in rice.
 The ETR2 receptor with a diverged His kinase domain is a Ser/Thr kinase, but not a His kinase, and can phosphorylate its receiver domain.
 Overexpression of ETR2 in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition.
 Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T_DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering.
 The effective panicles and seed_setting rate were reduced in the ETR2_overexpressing plants, while thousand_seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the ETR2_RNAi plants and the etr2 mutant compared with controls.
 Starch granules accumulated in the internodes of the ETR2_overexpressing plants, but not in the etr2 mutant.
 The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2_overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant.
 Conversely, the a_amylase gene RAmy3D was suppressed in ETR2_overexpressing plants but enhanced in the etr2 mutant.
 Thus, ETR2 may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes.
Floral organ identity and meristem determinacy in plants are controlled by combinations of activities mediated by MADS box genes.
 Here, we describe an AGL6_like gene in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (MFO1/MADS6), that regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy.
 In the flower of mfo1 mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic organs were observed.
 Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in mfo1 florets.
 Suppression of another rice AGL6_like gene, MADS17, caused no morphological abnormalities in the wild_type background, but it enhanced the phenotype in the mfo1 background, indicating that MADS17 has a minor but redundant function with that of MFO1.
 Whereas single mutants in either MFO1 or the SEPALLATA_like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the mfo1 lhs1 double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet meristem determinacy.
 We propose that rice AGL6_like genes help to control floral organ identity and the establishment and determinacy of the floral meristem redundantly with LHS1.
 In addition, chemical composition analysis indicated that cutin monomers were hardly detectable in the cyp704B2 anthers.
 The CYP704B2 transcript is specifically detected in the tapetum and the microspore from stage 8 of anther development to stage 10.
 Heterologous expression of CYP704B2 in yeast demonstrated that CYP704B2 catalyzes the production of v_hydroxylated fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbon chains.
In rice (Oryza sativa), brassinosteroids (BRs) induce cell elongation at the adaxial side of the lamina joint to promote leaf bending.
 Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending.
 ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix_loop_helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis.
 Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis.
 Thus, ILI1 and PRE1 may inactivate inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization.
 BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1.
 The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest.
 Here, we report a C2H2_type zinc finger transcription factor ART1 (for Al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to Al tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa).
 ART1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by Al treatment.
 ART1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells.
 A yeast one_hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance.
 Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants.
 In the Tos17_insertional zep1 mutants, homologous chromosomes align along the entire length of the chromosome, but the synaptonemal complex is not assembled in early prophase I.
 Transmission electron micrographs and immunodetection using an antibody against ZEP1 showed that ZEP1 is the central element of the synaptonemal complex.
 Although PAIR2 and MER3 were loaded normally in zep1, their dissociation was delayed severely compared with the wild type.
 In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process.
Rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm accumulates a massive amount of storage starch and storage proteins during seed development.
 The rice flo2 mutation resulted in reduced grain size and starch quality.
 Map_based cloning identified FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2), a member of a novel gene family conserved in plants, as the gene responsible for the rice flo2 mutation.
 FLO2 harbors a tetratricopeptide repeat motif, considered to mediate a protein–protein interactions.
 FLO2 was abundantly expressed in developing seeds coincident with production of storage starch and protein, as well as in leaves, while abundant expression of its homologs was observed only in leaves.
 The flo2 mutation decreased expression of genes involved in production of storage starch and storage proteins in the endosperm.
 Differences between cultivars in their responsiveness of FLO2 expression during high_temperature stress indicated that FLO2 may be involved in heat tolerance during seed development.
 Overexpression of FLO2 enlarged the size of grains significantly.
 These results suggest that FLO2 plays a pivotal regulatory role in rice grain size and starch quality by affecting storage substance accumulation in the endosperm.
In flowering plants, male meiosis produces four microspores, which develop into pollen grains and are released by anther dehiscence to pollinate female gametophytes.
 The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating male meiosis in rice (Oryza sativa) remain poorly understood.
 Here, we describe a rice pollen semi_sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (;40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (;50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence.
 Map_based molecular cloning revealed that PSS1 encodes a kinesin_1–like protein.
 PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles.
 Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis.
 Substitution of a conserved Arg (Arg_289) to His in the PSS1 motor domain nearly abolishes its microtubule_stimulated ATPase activity.
 Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant.
 Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin_1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice.
 Here, we describe a role for MADS3 in regulating late anther development and pollen formation.
 Consistent with this role, MADS3 is highly expressed in the tapetum and microspores during late anther development, and a newly identified MADS3 mutant allele, mads3_4, displays defective anther walls, aborted microspores, and complete male sterility.
 During late anther development, mads3_4 exhibits oxidative stress_related phenotypes.
 In vivo and in vitro assays showed that MADS3 is associated with the promoter of MT_1_4b, and recombinant MT_1_4b has superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity.
 Reducing the expression of MT_1_4b causes decreased pollen fertility and an increased level of superoxide anion in transgenic plants.
 Our findings suggest that MADS3 is a key transcriptional regulator that functions in rice male reproductive development, at least in part, by modulating ROS levels through MT_1_4b.
 The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response.
 Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion.
 Map_based cloning revealed that BUI1 encodes the class II formin FH5.
 Consistent with these in vitro biochemical activities of FH5/BUI1, the amount of filamentous actin decreased, and the longitudinal actin cables almost disappeared in bui1 cells.
The kinesins are a family of microtubule_based motor proteins that move directionally along microtubules and are involved in many crucial cellular processes, including cell elongation in plants.
 This reduced length is due to decreased cell elongation and can be rescued by exogenous gibberellic acid (GA3) treatment.
 GDD1 was cloned by a map_based approach, was expressed constitutively, and was found to encode the kinesin_like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (BC12).
 Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immuno_precipitation assays revealed that GDD1 bound to the element ACCAACTTGAA in the KO2 promoter.
 In addition, GDD1 was shown to have transactivation activity.
 Therefore, BC12/GDD1, a kinesin_like protein with transcription regulation activity, mediates cell elongation by regulating the GA biosynthesis pathway in rice.
 Here, we show that knockout of rice (Oryza sativa) APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 (API5), which encodes a putative homolog of antiapoptosis protein Api5 in animals, results in delayed degeneration of the tapetum due to inhibition of the tapetal PCD process leading to defects in formation of male gametophytes.
 Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD_box ATP_dependent RNA helicases, API5_INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2.
 AIP1 and AIP2 are homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Suppressor of Bad Response to Refrigeration1 protein 2 (SUB2p) that have critical roles in transcription elongation and pre_mRNA splicing.
 Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene.
 Suppression of Os AIP1/2 leads to down_regulation of CP1, resulting in sterility, which is highly similar to the effects of suppressed expression of Os CP1.
The circadian clock controls physiological traits such as flowering time, photosynthesis, and growth in plants under laboratory conditions.
 Time_course metabolome analyses of leaves revealed no trends of change in primary metabolites in osgi plants, and net photosynthetic rates and grain yields were not affected.
 Thus, net primary assimilation of rice was still robust in the face of such osgi mutation_related circadian clock defects in the field, unlike the case with defects caused by Arabidopsis thaliana toc1 and ztl mutations in the laboratory.
 We identified two allelic mutants, peter pan syndrome_1 (pps_1) and pps_2, that prolong the juvenile phase in rice (Oryza sativa) and showed that rice PPS is an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1.
 PPS is strongly expressed in the fourth and fifth leaves, suggesting that it regulates the onset of the adult phase downstream of MORI1 and upstream of miR156 and miR172.
 Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice PPS acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots.
AGAMOUS_LIKE6 (AGL6) genes play essential roles in flower development, but whether and how they work with floral organ identity genes remain less understood.
 Genetic analyses revealed that MADS6 specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral meristem determinacy redundantly with SUPERWOMAN1/MADS16 (B_gene) or MADS3 (C_gene).
 MADS6 was shown to define carpel/ovule development and floral determinacy by interacting with MADS13 (D_gene) and control the palea and floral meristem identities together with the YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF.
 Moreover, MADS6 can directly bind to a putative regulatory motif on MADS58 (C_gene), and mads6_1 mads58 displayed phenotypes similar to that of mads6_1.
 We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male_sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine.
 Chemical analysis revealed that dpw anthers had a dramatic reduction in cutin monomers and an altered composition of cuticular wax, as well as soluble fatty acids and alcohols.
 Using map_based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development.
 Biochemical analysis of the recombinant DPW enzyme shows that it is a novel fatty acid reductase that produces 1_hexadecanol and exhibits >270_fold higher specificity for palmiltoyl_acyl carrier protein than for C16.
 We identified a rice (Oryza sativa) dominant curly leaf mutant, curly flag leaf1 (cfl1), and cloned CFL1, which encodes a WW domain protein.
 We overexpressed both rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 in Arabidopsis thaliana; these transgenic plants showed severely impaired cuticle development, similar to that in cfl1 rice.
 Reduced expression of At CFL1 resulted in reinforcement of cuticle structure.
 At CFL1 was predominantly expressed in specialized epidermal cells and in regions where dehiscence and abscission occur.
 Biochemical evidence showed that At CFL1 interacts with HDG1, a class IV homeodomain_leucine zipper transcription factor.
 The expression of two cuticle development_associated genes, BDG and FDH, was downregulated in At CFL1 overexpressor and HDG1 suppression plants.
 Our results suggest that rice and Arabidopsis CFL1 negatively regulate cuticle development by affecting the function of HDG1, which regulates the downstream genes BDG and FDH.
Legume GRAS (GAI, RGA, SCR)_type transcription factors NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY1 (NSP1) and NSP2 are essential for rhizobium Nod factor_induced nodulation.
 However, legume NSP1 and NSP2 can be functionally replaced by nonlegume orthologs, including rice (Oryza sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants.
 Here, we show that NSP1 and NSP2 are indispensable for strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice.
 Mutant nsp1 plants do not produce SLs, whereas in M.
 truncatula, NSP2 is essential for conversion of orobanchol into didehydro_orobanchol, which is the main SL produced by this species.
 The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis.
 Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants.
 NSP1 and NSP2 are single_copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium_induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions.
The cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) phenotype in plants can be reversed by the action of nuclear_encoded fertility restorer (Rf) genes.
 In this study, we cloned the restorer gene Rf5 for Hong_Lian CMS in rice and studied its fertility restoration mechanism with respect to the processing of the CMS_associated transcript atp6_orfH79.
 RF5, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, was unable to bind to this CMS_associated transcript; however, a partner protein of RF5 (GRP162, a Gly_rich protein encoding 162 amino acids) was identified to bind to atp6_orfH79.
 GRP162 was found to physically interact with RF5 and to bind to atp6_orfH79 via an RNA recognition motif.
 Furthermore, we found that RF5 and GRP162 are both components of a restoration of fertility complex (RFC) that is 400 to 500 kD in size and can cleave CMS_associated transcripts in vitro.
 Evidence that a PPR protein interacts directly with a Gly_rich protein to form a subunit of the RFC provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying fertility restoration.
 We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (ila1), resulting from a T_DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene.
 The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid_related mutants.
 Phosphorylation assays revealed that ILA1 is a functional kinase with Ser/Thr kinase activity.
 ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints.
 Yeast two_hybrid screening identified six closely related ILA1 interacting proteins (IIPs) of unknown function.
 Using representative IIPs, the interaction of ILA1 and IIPs was confirmed in vivo.
 Furthermore, ILA1 could phosphorylate IIP4, indicating that IIPs may be the downstream substrates of ILA1.
 ILA1 is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint.
The switch from mitosis to meiosis is one of the most pivotal events in eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction.
 However, the mechanisms orchestrating meiosis initiation remain elusive, particularly in plants.
 We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (MIL1).
 The mil1 mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility.
 Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that mil1 anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores.
 Furthermore, analysis of mil1 msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of MIL1, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to mil1.
 MIL1 encodes a plant_specific CC_type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors.
 These results suggest meiotic entry in microsporocytes is directed by an anther_specific mechanism, which requires MIL1 activity, and redox regulation might play important roles in this process.
Seed shattering is an important agricultural trait in crop domestication.
 SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication.
 However, the regulatory pathways of seed shattering in rice remain unknown.
 Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line.
 The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice.
 Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4.
 We also identified a frameshift mutant of SH4 that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering.
 Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification.
 qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation.
 TOB1 encodes a YABBY protein, which is closely related to FILAMENTOUS FLOWER in Arabidopsis thaliana, and is expressed in the lateral organ primordia without any patterns of polarization.
 No TOB1 expression is detected in the meristem, so TOB1 may act non–cell autonomously to maintain proper meristem organization and is therefore likely to play an important role in rice spikelet development.
 Suppressed expression of MADS29 resulted in abnormal seed development; the seeds were shrunken, displayed a low grain_filling rate and suppressed starch biosynthesis, and contained abnormal starch granules.
 Detailed analysis indicated that the abnormal seed development is due to defective programmed cell death (PCD) of the nucellus and nucellar projection, which was confirmed by a TUNEL assay and transcriptome analysis.
 Further studies showed that expression of MADS29 is induced by auxin and MADS29 protein binds directly to the putative promoter regions of genes that encode a Cys protease and nucleotide binding site–Leu_rich repeat proteins, thereby stimulating the PCD.
 This study identifies MADS29 as a key regulator of early rice seed development by regulating the PCD of maternal tissues.
 Nramp5 was constitutively expressed in the roots and encodes a plasma membrane–localized protein.
 Nramp5 was polarly localized at the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells.
 Knockout of Nramp5 resulted in a significant reduction in growth and grain yield, especially when grown at low Mn concentrations.
 Taken together, Nramp5 is a major transporter of Mn and Cd and is responsible for the transport of Mn and Cd from the external solution to root cells.
 Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)_like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa).
 PAP2 is a MADS box gene belonging to a grass_specific subclade of the SEPALLATA subfamily.
 Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM.
 PAP2 physically interacts with MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo.
 Based on these results, we propose that PAP2 and the three AP1/FUL_like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.
Chromatin modifications affect flowering time in the long_day plant Arabidopsis thaliana, but the role of histone methylation in flowering time regulation of rice (Oryza sativa), a short_day plant, remains to be elucidated.
 SDG724 functions as a histone methyltransferase in vitro and contributes to a major fraction of global histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation in vivo.
 Expression analyses of flowering time genes in wild_type and lvp1 mutants revealed that Early heading date1, but not Heading date1, are misregulated in lvp1 mutants.
 In addition, the double mutant of lvp1 with photoperiod sensitivity5 (se5) flowered later than the se5 single mutant, indicating that lvp1 delays flowering time irrespective of photoperiod.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that lvp1 had reduced levels of H3K36me2/3 at MADS50 and RFT1.
 This suggests that the divergent functions of paralogs RFT1 and Hd3a, and of MADS50 and MADS51, are in part due to differential H3K36me2/3 deposition, which also correlates with higher expression levels of MADS50 and RFT1 in flowering promotion in rice.
 Transcription of HDT701 is increased in the compatible reaction and decreased in the incompatible reaction after infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.
 Overexpression of HDT701 in transgenic rice leads to decreased levels of histone H4 acetylation and enhanced susceptibility to the rice pathogens M.
 oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo).
 By contrast, silencing of HDT701 in transgenic rice causes elevated levels of histone H4 acetylation and elevated transcription of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and defense_related genes, increased generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen_associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, as well as enhanced resistance to both M.
 oryzae and Xoo.
 We also found that HDT701 can bind to defense_related genes to regulate their expression.
 Taken together, these results demonstrate that HDT701 negatively regulates innate immunity by modulating the levels of histone H4 acetylation of PRR and defense_related genes in rice.
 We found that Epi_df has no changes in nucleotide sequence but is hypomethylated in the 5' region of FIE1 and has reduced H3K9me2 and increased H3K4me3.
 In Epi_df, FIE1 was ectopically expressed and its imprinting was disrupted.
 FIE1 interacted with rice Enhancer of Zeste homologs, consistent with its role in H3K27me3 repression.
 Ectopic expression cf FIE1 in Epi_df resulted in alteration of H3K27me3 levels in hundreds of genes.
 Here, we report two homologous rice (Oryza sativa) lysin motif–containing proteins, LYP4 and LYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin.
 Accordingly, silencing of either LYP specifically impaired PGN_ or chitin_ but not LPS_induced defense responses in rice, including reactive oxygen species generation, defense gene activation, and callose deposition, leading to compromised resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae and fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.
 Collectively, our data support the notion that LYP4 and LYP6 are promiscuous PRRs for PGN and chitin in rice innate immunity.
 Although CLV_like genes, such as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, have been shown to be involved in maintenance of the reproductive meristems in rice (Oryza sativa), current understanding of meristem maintenance remains insufficient.
 In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2_LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase.
 In addition, we found that WUSCHEL_RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) promotes the undifferentiated state of the meristem in rice and that WOX4 function is associated with cytokinin action.
 Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2).
 Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
 Rice YSL16 was expressed in the roots, leaves, and unelongated nodes at the vegetative growth stage and highly expressed in the upper nodes at the reproductive stage.
 YSL16 was expressed at the phloem of nodes and vascular tissues of leaves.
 At the reproductive stage, a higher Cu concentration was found in the flag leaf and husk, but less Cu was present in the brown rice, resulting in a significant reduction in fertility in the knockout line.
 Rice YSL16 transported the Cu_nicotianamine complex in yeast.
 The PT11 lineage of proteins from mono_ and dicotyledons is most closely related to homologs from the ancient moss, indicating an early evolutionary origin.
 Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis.
 For symbiotic Pi uptake, however, only PT11 is necessary and sufficient.
 Here, we show that the avirulence effector AvrPiz_t from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae preferentially accumulates in the specialized structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex and is then translocated into rice (Oryza sativa) cells.
 oryzae, indicating that AvrPiz_t functions to suppress pathogen_associated molecular pattern (PAMP)_triggered immunity in rice.
 Interaction assays show that AvrPiz_t suppresses the ubiquitin ligase activity of the rice RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 and that, in return, APIP6 ubiquitinates AvrPiz_t in vitro.
 Silencing of APIP6 in transgenic rice leads to a significant reduction of flg22_induced ROS generation, suppression of defense_related gene expression, and enhanced susceptibility of rice plants to M.
 The brk1 mutants are sterile due to the precocious separation of sister chromatids at the onset of anaphase I.
 Although the homologs can faithfully separate from each other at the end of meiosis I, the uncorrected merotelic attachment of paired sister kinetochores at the early stage of metaphase I in brk1 reduces the tension across homologous kinetochores, causes the metaphase I spindle to be aberrantly shaped, and subsequently affects the synchronicity of homolog separation at the onset of anaphase I.
 Therefore, we speculate that BRK1 may be required for normal localization of Aurora kinase before the onset of metaphase I, which is responsible for correcting the merotelic attachment.
 Two NB_LRR protein_coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1_CO39.
 RGA4 and RGA5 also mediate recognition of the unrelated M.
 oryzae effector AVR_Pia, indicating that the corresponding R proteins possess dual recognition specificity.
Plasticity of root growth in response to environmental cues and stresses is a fundamental characteristic of land plants.
 However, the molecular basis underlying the regulation of root growth under stressful conditions is poorly understood.
 Here, we report that a rice nuclear factor, RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 (RSS3), regulates root cell elongation during adaptation to salinity.
 Loss of function of RSS3 only moderately inhibits cell elongation under normal conditions, but it provokes spontaneous root cell swelling, accompanied by severe root growth inhibition, under saline conditions.
 RSS3 is preferentially expressed in the root tip and forms a ternary complex with class_C basic helix_loop_helix (bHLH) transcription factors and JASMONATE ZIM_DOMAIN proteins, the latter of which are the key regulators of jasmonate (JA) signaling.
 The mutated protein arising from the rss3 allele fails to interact with bHLH factors, and the expression of a significant portion of JA_responsive genes is upregulated in rss3.
 These results, together with the known roles of JAs in root growth regulation, suggest that RSS3 modulates the expression of JA_responsive genes and plays a crucial role in a mechanism that sustains root cell elongation at appropriate rates under stressful conditions.
 Loss of SERF1 impairs the salt_inducible expression of genes encoding members of a mitogen_activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and salt tolerance–mediating TFs.
 Furthermore, we show that SERF1_dependent genes are H2O2 responsive and demonstrate that SERF1 binds to the promoters of MAPK KINASE KINASE6 (MAP3K6), MAPK5, DEHYDRATION_RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING2A (DREB2A), and ZINC FINGER PROTEIN179 (ZFP179) in vitro and in vivo.
 SERF1 also directly induces its own gene expression.
 In addition, SERF1 is a phosphorylation target of MAPK5, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity of SERF1 toward its direct target genes.
 In agreement, plants deficient for SERF1 are more sensitive to salt stress compared with the wild type, while constitutive overexpression of SERF1 improves salinity tolerance.
 We propose that SERF1 amplifies the reactive oxygen species–activated MAPK cascade signal during the initial phase of salt stress and translates the salt_induced signal into an appropriate expressional response resulting in salt tolerance.
In meiosis, homologous recombination entails programmed DNA double_strand break (DSB) formation and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly coupled with the DSB repair.
 CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion.
 Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two_hybrid assays.
 CRC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae pachytene checkpoint2 (Pch2) and Mus musculus THYROID RECEPTOR_INTERACTING PROTEIN13 (TRIP13) and may be a conserved SC component.
 Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation.
 CRC1 interacts with HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation.
 We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes.
 The roles of CRC1 identified here have not been reported for Pch2 or TRIP13.
 We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, An_1, which regulates long awn formation in O.
 An_1 encodes a basic helix_loop_helix protein, which regulates cell division.
 The nearly_isogenic line (NIL_An_1) carrying a wild allele An_1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4.
 Transgenic studies confirmed that An_1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle.
 Genetic variations in the An_1 locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice.
 Population genetic analysis of wild and cultivated rice showed a significant reduction in nucleotide diversity of the An_1 locus in rice cultivars, suggesting that the An_1 locus was a major target for artificial selection.
 Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An_1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice.
 Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) Jumonji C (jmjC) protein gene JMJ705 encodes a histone Lys demethylase that specifically reverses H3K27me2/3 in rice.
 The expression of JMJ705 is induced by stress signals and during pathogen infection.
 Overexpression of the gene reduces the resting level of H3K27me2/3 resulting in preferential activation of H3K27me3_marked biotic stress_responsive genes and enhances rice resistance to the bacterial blight disease pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae.
 Further analysis revealed that JMJ705 is involved in methyl jasmonate–induced dynamic removal of H3K27me3 and gene activation.
 The results suggest that JMJ705 is a biotic stress_responsive H3K27me2/3 demethylase that may remove H3K27me3 from marked defense_related genes and increase their basal and induced expression during pathogen infection.
High salinity causes growth inhibition and shoot bleaching in plants that do not tolerate high salt (glycophytes), including most crops.
 NaCl rapidly activates SIT1, and in the presence of salt, as SIT1 kinase activity increased, plant survival decreased.
 SIT1 phosphorylates MPK3 and 6, and their activation by salt requires SIT1.
 SIT1 mediates ethylene production and salt_induced ethylene signaling.
 SIT1 promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to growth inhibition and plant death under salt stress, which occurred in an MPK3/6_ and ethylene signaling_dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Male sterility plays an important role in F1 hybrid seed production.
 We identified a male_sterile rice (Oryza sativa) mutant with impaired pollen development and a single T_DNA insertion in the transcription factor gene bHLH142.
 Knockout mutants of bHLH142 exhibited retarded meiosis and defects in tapetal programmed cell death.
 RT_PCR and in situ hybridization analyses showed that bHLH142 is specifically expressed in the anther, in the tapetum, and in meiocytes during early meiosis.
 Three basic helix_loop_helix transcription factors, UDT1 (bHLH164), TDR1 (bHLH5), and EAT1/DTD1 (bHLH141) are known to function in rice pollen development.
 bHLH142 acts downstream of UDT1 and GAMYB but upstream of TDR1 and EAT1 in pollen development.
 In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that bHLH142 and TDR1 proteins interact.
 Transient promoter assays demonstrated that regulation of the EAT1 promoter requires bHLH142 and TDR1.
 Consistent with these results, 3D protein structure modeling predicted that bHLH142 and TDR1 form a heterodimer to bind to the EAT1 promoter.
 EAT1 positively regulates the expression of AP37 and AP25, which induce tapetal programmed cell death.
 Thus, in this study, we identified bHLH142 as having a pivotal role in tapetal programmed cell death and pollen development.
 Curiously, CPK18 was shown to phosphorylate and activate MPK5 without affecting the phosphorylation of its TXY motif.
 Instead, CPK18 was found to predominantly phosphorylate two Thr residues (Thr_14 and Thr_32) that are widely conserved in MAPKs from land plants.
 Further analyses reveal that the newly identified CPK18_MPK5 pathway represses defense gene expression and negatively regulates rice blast resistance.
The rice blast resistance (R) gene Pi_ta mediates gene_for_gene resistance against strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that express avirulent alleles of AVR_Pita.
 Pi_ta encodes a predicted 928–amino acid cytoplasmic receptor with a centrally localized nucleotide binding site.
 A single_copy gene, Pi_ta shows low constitutive expression in both resistant and susceptible rice.
 Susceptible rice varieties contain pi_ta– alleles encoding predicted proteins that share a single amino acid difference relative to the Pi_ta resistance protein.
 Further analysis revealed that the Hd1 QTL corresponds to a gene that is a homolog of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis.
 Se1 is allelic to the Hd1 QTL, as determined by analysis of two se1 mutants, HS66 and HS110.
 The amount of Hd1 mRNA was not greatly affected by a change in length of the photoperiod.
 We suggest that Hd1 functions in the promotion of heading under short_day conditions and in inhibition under long_day conditions.
 It has been demonstrated previously that one of these genes, OsMADS1 (for Oryza sativa MADS box gene1), is expressed preferentially in flowers and causes early flowering when ectopically expressed in tobacco plants.
 In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of OsMADS1 in rice also results in early flowering.
 To further investigate the role of OsMADS1 during rice flower development, we generated transgenic rice plants expressing altered OsMADS1 genes that contain missense mutations in the MADS domain.
 The map position of OsMADS1 is closely linked to that of lhs1 on chromosome 3.
 Examination of lhs1 revealed that it contains two missense mutations in the OsMADS1 MADS domain.
9_kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild_type OsMADS1 gene rescued the mutant phenotypes.
 In addition, ectopic expression of the OsMADS1 gene isolated from the lhs1 line resulted in lhs1_conferred phenotypes.
 These lines of evidence demonstrate that OsMADS1 is the lhs1 gene.
 Linkage analysis showed that the OsBRI1 gene is closely linked to the d61 locus.
 Single nucleotide substitutions found at different sites of the d61 alleles would give rise to amino acid changes in the corresponding polypeptides.
 Furthermore, introduction of the entire OsBRI1 coding region, including the 59 and 39 flanking sequences, into d61 plants complemented the mutation to display the wild_type phenotype.
 Transgenic plants carrying the antisense strand of the OsBRI1 transcript showed similar or even more severe phenotypes than those of the d61 mutants.
 Our results show that OsBRI1 functions in various growth and developmental processes in rice, including (1) internode elongation, by inducing the formation of the intercalary meristem and the longitudinal elongation of internode cells; (2) bending of the lamina joint; and (3) skotomorphogenesis.
 These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway.
 SLR1 maps to OsGAI in rice and has significant homology with height_regulating genes, such as RHT_1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Ar_abidopsis.
 Furthermore, introduction of a 6_kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild_type SLR1 gene into the slr1_1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal.
 These results indicate that the slr1_1 mutant is caused by a loss_of_function mutation of the SLR1 gene, which is an ortholog of GAI, RGA, RHT, and D8.
 We also succeeded in producing GA_insensitive dwarf rice by transforming wild_type rice with a modified SLR1 gene construct that has a 17–amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region.
 lntroduction of the cloned OSH7 gene into rice resulted in altered leaf morphology, which was similar to that of the maize morphological mutant Knotted_7 (Knl), indicating that OSHl is a rice gene homologous to the maize Kn7 gene.
 We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (OsWRKY45), plays a pivotal role in BTH_induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling.
 Rice resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, induced by both types of plant activator, was markedly reduced in WRKY45_knockdown (WRKY45_kd) rice, indicating a universal role for WRKY45 in chemical_induced resistance.
The leaf blast resistance of WRKY45_ox rice plants was much higher than that of other known blast_resistant varieties.
 WRKY45_ox plants also showed strong panicle blast resistance.
 BTH_induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae was compromised in WRKY45_kd rice, whereas WRKY45_ox plants were highly resistant to this pathogen.
Jasmonic acid (JA) is a well_known defence hormone, but its biological function and mechanism in rice root development are less understood.
 Here, we describe a JA_induced putative receptor_like protein (OsRLK, AAL87185) functioning in root development in rice.
 No significant change of JA level appeared in the roots between the transgenic rice line and WT.
 Western blotting revealed OsRMC induced by JA.
 Our results suggest that OsRMC of the DUF26 subfamily involved in JA signal transduction mediates root development and negatively regulates root curling in rice.
Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important negative regulator of light_regulated coleoptile elongation in rice.
 In far_red and blue lights, osjar1 coleoptiles were longer if compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that OsJar1 participates in the suppression of coleoptile elongation in these light conditions, while the mutant did not show a clear phenotype in red light.
The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably.
 Unexpectedly, blue light_induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA_deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling.
 In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up_regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl_jasmonic acid (MeJA).
 Expression analysis in rice suggests that OscFBP1 plays a major role in the cytosolic conversion of trioseP to sucrose in leaves during the day.
 The isolated OscFBP1 mutants exhibited markedly decreased photosynthetic rates and severe growth retardation with reduced chlorophyll content, which results in plant death.
 In the oscfbp1 mutants, products of glycolysis and the TCA cycle were significantly increased.
 A partitioning experiment of 14C_labelled photo_assimilates revealed altered carbon distributions including a slight increase in the insoluble fraction representing transitory starch, a significant decrease in the neutral fraction corresponding to soluble sugars and a high accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates and carboxylic acid fractions in the oscfbp1 mutants.
 Daily oscillations in Rdd1 expression were retained after transferring to continuous dark (DD) or light (LL) conditions, indicating circadian regulation.
 However, Rdd1 showed arrhythmic expression in etiolated coleoptiles.
 Experiments revealed that the Rdd1 transcript accumulated up to 1 h after transferring from DD to LL conditions and decreased thereafter.
 We examined Rdd1 expression using phytochrome (phy)_deficient mutants, and the results showed that phyA and most likely phyB contributed to the regulation of Rdd1 expression.
 To further examine the role of Rdd1, transgenic rice plants were produced that carried Rdd1 in either a sense (RDD1_S) or antisense (RDD1_AS) orientation, driven by a constitutive promoter.
 The expression of endogenous Rdd1 in response to far_red light was found to be modified in RDD1_AS plants compared with wild_type (WT) or RDD1_S plants.
 In addition, RDD1_AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1_S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000_grain weight were also recorded.
 This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy_regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice.
 We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering.
 Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56.
 Knock_out of OsMADS50 caused a late_flowering phenotype only under LD conditions.
 Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD.
 In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased.
 On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged.
 These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1_Ehd1 in regulating LD_dependent flowering.
 These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes.
 This OsENOD93_1 gene responded significantly to both N induction and N reduction.
 Transgenic rice plants over_expressing the OsENOD93_1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield.
 This OsENOD93_1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild_type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria.
 In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93_1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis.
Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of Arabidopsis EDR1.
 We show here that OsEDR1_suppressing/knockout (KO) plants, which developed spontaneous lesions on the leaves, have enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo) causing bacterial blight disease.
 Knockout of OsEDR1 suppressed the ACC synthase (ACS) gene family, which encodes the rate_limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC.
 In the rice_Xoo interaction, OsEDR1 transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that, in turn, suppresses SA_ and JA_associated defence signalling.
 Here, we investigated OsRAN2 involved in regulation of cell division during cold stress in rice.
 Expression of OsRAN2 was increased under cold treatment, but not during salt and drought stress.
 Overexpression of OsRAN2 enhanced cold tolerance in rice.
 The transgenic rice over_expressing OsRAN2 showed maintained cell division, decreased proportion of cells with intranuclear tubulin and formation of a normal nuclear envelope under the cold condition.
 Our study suggests a mechanism for OsRAN2 in regulating cold resistance in rice by maintaining cell division through promoting the normal export of intranuclear tubulin at the end of mitosis.
 Both mutant and NT plants exhibited similar photosynthesis (CO2 assimilation and photochemical efficiency) under both normal and stress conditions.
In higher plants, a small subunit of Rubisco is encoded for by an RBCS multigene family in the nuclear genome.
 Here, four RBCS genes that are highly expressed in leaf blaedes of rice (Oryza sativa L, were individually suppressed by RNAi, and the effects on leaf Rubisco content were examined at seedling, vegetative and reproductive stages.
 Rubisco contents in each transgenic line declined irrespective of growth stage, and the ratios of Rubisco_N to total N were 66–96% of wild_type levels.
 The mRNA levels of the suppressed RBCS genes declined significantly, whereas those of the unsuppressed ones did not change drastically.
 These results indicate that four RBCS genes all contribute to accumulation of Rubisco holoenzyme irrespective of growth stage and that suppression of one RBCS gene is not fully compensated by other RBCS genes.
 Additionally, the mRNA levels of the large subunit of Rubisco showed a change similar to that of total RBCS mRNA level irrespective of genotype and growth stage.
 These results suggest that gene expression of RBCS and RBCL is regulated in a coordinated manner at the transcript level in rice.
Rice internodes are vital for supporting high_yield panicles, which are controlled by various factors such as cell division, cell elongation and cell wall biosynthesis.
 Previously, we reported that parenchyma cells in the elongated internodes of d50 ectopically deposit cell wall phenolics.
 In this study, we revealed that D50 encodes putative inositol polyphosphate 5_phosphatase (5PTase), which may be involved in phosphoinositide signalling required for many essential cellular functions, such as cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis and vesicular trafficking in eukaryotes.
 The d50 mutation induced abnormally oriented cell division, irregular deposition of cell wall pectins and thick actin bundles in the parenchyma cells of the IM, resulting in abnormally organized cell files of the internode parenchyma and dwarf phenotype.
 Our results suggest that the putative 5PTase, encoded by D50, is essential for IM formation,including the direction of cell division, deposition of cell wall pectins and control of actin organization.
 In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe_deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa.
 Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots.
 Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap.
 T_DNA had been integrated into the K_box region of Oryza sativa MADS50 (OsMADS50), which shares 50.
 While overexpression of OsMADS50 caused extremely early flowering at the callus stage, OsMADS50 RNAi plants exhibited phenotypes of late flowering and an increase in the number of elongated internodes.
 This confirmed that the phenotypes observed in the knockout (KO) plants are because of the mutation in OsMADS50.
 RT_PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ub).
We have isolated a floury endosperm_4 (flo4) rice mutant with a floury_white endosperm but a normal outer portion.
 The flo4 kernels weighed about 6% less than wild_type ones.
 Moreover, lipid contents were significantly increased in the flo4 kernels.
 Our results suggest that cytosolic PPDK functions in rice to modulate carbon metabolism during grain filling.
 ARL1 is a nuclear protein and can form homodimers.
 ARL1 is an auxin_ and ethylene_responsive gene, and the expression pattern of ARL1 in roots parallels auxin distribution.
 Our findings suggest that ARL1 is an auxin_responsive factor involved in auxin_mediated cell dedifferentiation, and that it promotes the initial cell division in the pericycle cells adjacent to the peripheral vascular cylinder in the stem.
 Similarly, overexpression of (At)NPR1 in rice enhances resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
The rice SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling.
 Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA_type protein suppressing GA signals in rice.
 OsIAA3 is one of these family members whose expression is rapidly increased in response to auxin.
 We produced transgenic rice harboring mOsIAA3_GR, which can overproduce mutant OsIAA3 protein containing an amino acid change in domain II to cause a gain_of_function phenotype, by treatment with dexamethasone.
 The transgenic rice was insensitive to auxin and gravitropic stimuli, and exhibited short leaf blades, reduced crown root formation, and abnormal leaf formation.
 The dominant resistance gene, Pi_d2 [previously named Pi_d(t)2], present in the rice variety Digu, confers gene_for_gene resistance to the Chinese blast strain, ZB15.
 Pi_d2 was previously mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 6.
 In this study, the Pi_d2 gene was isolated by a map_based cloning strategy.
 Pi_d2 encodes a receptor_like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of a bulb_type mannose specific binding lectin (B_lectin) and an intracellular serine–threonine kinase domain.
 Pi_d2 is a single_copy gene that is constitutively expressed in the rice variety Digu.
 Transgenic plants carrying the Pi_d2 transgene confer race_specific resistance to the M.
 The Pi_d2 protein is plasma membrane localized.
 A single amino acid difference at position 441 of Pi_d2 distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of rice blast resistance gene Pi_d2.
 Because of its novel extracellular domain, Pi_d2 represents a new class of plant resistance genes.
 Here we describe the functional characterization of a rice AG_like MADS_box protein, OsMDP1 (Oryza sativa MADS_domain_containing protein 1).
 A partial cDNA encoding a MADS_box domain was identified via highthroughput screening of rice brassinolide_regulated genes, and the full_length cDNA was subsequently isolated via screening of a cDNA library constructed from rice materials at tillering stage.
 Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root_elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath.
 Further studies revealed that transcription of OsMDP1 is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by brassinolide treatment.
 OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations.
 Moreover, transgenic plants showed hypersensitivities to exogenous brassinolide in terms of lamina joint inclination and coleoptile elongation.
 OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell_wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling.
 To understand the function of SPY in GA signaling in rice, we isolated a rice SPINDLY homolog (OsSPY) and produced knockdown transgenic plants in which OsSPY expression was reduced by introducing its antisense or RNAi construct.
 In knockdown plants, the enhanced elongation of lower internodes was correlated with decreased levels of OsSPY expression, similar to the spindly phenotype of Arabidopsis spy mutants, suggesting that OsSPY also functions as a negative factor in GA signaling in rice.
 The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA_deficient and GA_insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function.
 The suppression of OsSPY function in a GA_insensitive mutant, gid2, also caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, but did not change the amount of SLR1.
 This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1.
 In addition to the GA_related phenotypes, OsSPY antisense and RNAi plants showed increased lamina joint bending, which is a brassinosteroid_related phenotype, indicating that OsSPY may play roles both in GA signaling and in the brassinosteroid pathway.
Development and organogenesis in both dicot and monocot plants are highly dependent on polar auxin transport (PAT), which requires the proper asymmetric localization of both auxin influx and efflux carriers.
 Here, we show that over_expression of OsAGAP, an ARF_GTPase_activating protein (ARF_GAP) in rice, impaired PAT and interfered with both primary and lateral root development.
 Together, our data suggest that OsAGAP has a specific role in regulating vesicle trafficking pathways such as the auxin influx pathway, which in turn controls auxin_dependent root growth in plants.
Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait for grain production.
 The HIGH_TILLERING DWARF1 (HTD1) gene encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3.
 Complementation analyses for HTD1 confirm that the defect in HTD1 is responsible for both high_tillering and dwarf phenotypes in the htd1 mutant.
 Despite ample information on the molecular mechanisms that control the transition from SAM to inflorescence meristems, little is known about the mechanism for inflorescence development, especially in monocots.
 Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development.
 Genetic segregation analysis suggested that the Rd and A loci are identical, and both encode dihydroflavonol_4_reductase (DFR).
 The introduction of the DFR gene into an Rcrd mutant resulted in red_colored rice, which was brown in the original mutant, demonstrating that the Rd locus encodes the DFR protein.
 Accumulation of proanthocyanidins was observed in the transformants by the introduction of the Rd gene into the rice Rcrd line.
 A search for the Rc gene, which encodes a transacting regulatory factor, was conducted using available DNA markers and the Rice Genome Automated Annotation System program.
 Brown_colored seeds were obtained from transgenic plants by the introduction of a gene containing the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) motif, demonstrating that the Rc gene encodes a bHLH protein.
 Comparison of the Rc locus among rice accessions showed that a 14_bp deletion occurred only in the rc locus.
Rice EL5 is an ATL family gene characterized by a transmembrane domain at the N_terminal and a RING_H2 finger domain (RFD), which exhibits ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity.
 To elucidate the physiological roles of EL5, we analyzed transgenic rice plants overexpressing mutant EL5 proteins that are impaired in E3 activity to various degrees.
 Plants expressing EL5C153A and EL5W165A, which encode an inactive E3, showed a rootless phenotype accompanied by cell death in root primordia, and those expressing EL5V162A, with moderately impaired E3 activity, formed short crown roots with necrotic lateral roots.
 The dominant_negative phenotype was specifically observed in root meristems where EL5 is expressed, and not recovered by exogenous auxin.
 When wild_type EL5 was transcriptionally overexpressed, the EL5 protein was barely detected by Western blotting.
 Neither treatment with a proteasome inhibitor nor mutation of the sole lysine residue, a potential target of ubiquitination, resulted in increased EL5 accumulation, whereas mutations in the RFD led to increased EL5 accumulation.
 The stabilized EL5 without the RFD was localized in the plasma membrane.
 Deletion of the transmembrane domain prevented the EL5 from localizing in the membrane and from exerting an inhibitory effect on root formation.
 We concluded that EL5 plays a major role as a membrane_anchored E3 for the maintenance of cell viability after the initiation of root primordial formation.
 In addition, we propose that EL5 is an unstable protein, of which degradation is regulated by the RFD in a proteasome_independent manner.
 Although responses to Fe deficiency in graminaceous plants, such as increased production and secretion of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), have been described, the gene regulation mechanisms related to these responses are largely unknown.
 To elucidate the regulation mechanisms of the genes related to Fe acquisition in graminaceous plants, we characterized the Fe_deficiency_inducible basic helix_loop_helix transcription factor OsIRO2 in rice.
 In yeast cells, OsIRO2 functioned as a transcriptional activator.
 In rice, overexpression of OsIRO2 resulted in increased MAs secretion, whereas repression of OsIRO2 resulted in lower MAs secretion and hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency.
 The expression of the genes for nicotianamine synthase, a key enzyme in MAs synthesis, was notably affected by the level of OsIRO2 expression.
 Microarray analysis demonstrated that OsIRO2 regulates 59 Fe_deficiency_induced genes in roots.
 Some of these genes, including two transcription factors upregulated by Fe deficiency, possessed the OsIRO2 binding sequence in their upstream regions.
 OsIRO2 possesses a homologous sequence of the Fe_deficiency_responsive cis_acting elements (IDEs) in its upstream region.
The OsNAC6 gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice.
 Expression of OsNAC6 is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity.
 OsNAC6 gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease.
 A transactivation assay using a yeast system demonstrated that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator, and transient localization studies with OsNAC6–sGFP fusion protein revealed its nuclear localization.
 Transgenic rice plants over_expressing OsNAC6 constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields.
 By utilizing stressinducible promoters, such as the OsNAC6 promoter, it is hoped that stress_inducible over_expression of OsNAC6 in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of OsNAC6 on growth under normal growth conditions.
 A transient transactivation assay showed that OsNAC6 activates the expression of at least two genes, including a gene encoding peroxidase.
 Collectively, these results indicate that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants.
 We conclude that OsNAC6 may serve as a useful biotechnological tool for the improvement of stress tolerance in various kinds of plants.
In contrast to animals, in which products of meiosis differentiate directly into sperm, flowering plants employ a specific mechanism to give rise to functional sperm cells, the specifics of which remain largely unknown.
 A previous study revealed that, compared to yeast and vertebrates, which have two proteins (Rad21 and its meiosis_specific variant Rec8) that play a vital role in sister chromatid cohesion and segregation for mitosis and meiosis, respectively, the rice genome encodes four Rad21/Rec8 proteins (OsRad21s).
 In this paper, phylogenetic and immunostaining analyses reveal that OsRad21_3 is an orthologue of yeast Rad21.
 OsRAD21_3 transcript and protein accumulated preferentially in flowers, with low levels in vegetative tissues.
 OsRAD21_3_deficient RNAi lines showed arrested pollen mitosis, aberrant pollen chromosome segregation and aborted pollen grains, which led to disrupted pollen viability.
 However, male meiosis in these RNAi lines did not appear to be severely disrupted, which suggests that the main involvement of OsRAD21_3 is in post_meiotic pollen development by affecting pollen mitosis.
 Furthermore, of the four OsRAD21 genes in the rice genome, only OsRAD21_3 was expressed in pollen grains.
 Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1) mutants revealed that APO1 positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems.
 In addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy.
 Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates class_C floral homeotic genes, but not class_B genes.
 Molecular studies revealed that APO1 encodes an F_box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class_B genes.
 Overexpression of APO1 caused an increase in inflorescence branches and spikelets.
 As the mutant inflorescences and flowers differed considerably between apo1 and ufo, the functions of APO1 and UFO appear to have diverged during evolution.
 Here, we show that the concept of apical dominance can be applied to tiller bud outgrowth of rice.
 D10 is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching.
 D10 expression predominantly occurs in vascular cells in most organs.
 Real_time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of D10 mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin.
 Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1).
 No such effects were found for D3 or HTD1, the MAX2 and MAX3 orthologs, respectively, of rice.
 These findings imply that D10 transcription might be a critical step in the regulation of the branching inhibitor pathway.
 We initially identified the V2 gene by positional cloning of the rice v2 mutant.
 The v2 mutant is temperature_sensitive and develops chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures.
 The v2 mutation causes inhibition of chloroplast differentiation; in particular, it disrupts the chloroplast translation machinery during early leaf development [Sugimoto et al.
 Phenotypic analysis of rice seedlings with RNAi knockdown of cytosolic GK (designated cGK) showed that cGK is indispensable for the growth and development of plants, but not for chloroplast development.
Genes that control ovule identity were first identified in Petunia.
 Later in Arabidopsis it was shown that three genes, SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2, and SEEDSTICK (STK), redundantly control ovule identity, because in the stk shp1 shp2 triple mutant ovules lose identity and are transformed into carpel and leaf_like structures.
 OsMADS13 is the rice ortholog of STK, FBP7, and FBP11.
 We show that the osmads13 mutant is female sterile and that ovules are converted into carpelloid structures.
 Furthermore, making carpels inside carpels, the osmads13 flower is indeterminate, showing that OsMADS13 also has a function in floral meristem determinacy.
 Furthermore, combining the osmads13 and the osmads21 mutants did not result in any additive ovule defect, indicating that osmads21 does not control ovule identity.
 These results suggest that during evolution the D_lineage gene OsMADS21 has lost its ability to determine ovule identity.
Most short vegetative phase (SVP)_group MADS_box genes control meristem identity and flowering time.
 Here, we investigated the functional roles of two close homologs, OsMADS22 and OsMADS55, by generating single, double and triple RNAi lines and overexpression lines.
 Analyses of the plants showed that their roles in regulating meristem identity are well conserved; however, the involvement of these genes in determining flowering time has diversified.
 Most importantly, OsMADS55 works as a major negative regulator of BR responses, and OsMADS22 functions to support OsMADS55.
 Whereas single OsMADS55 RNAi plants display weak BR responses in the lamina joint (LJ), OsMADS22_OsMADS55 double and OsMADS22_OsMADS47_OsMADS55 triple RNAi plants manifest dramatic BR responses with regard to LJ inclination, coleoptile elongation and senescence.
Pre_harvest sprouting (PHS) or vivipary in cereals is an important agronomic trait that results in significant economic loss.
 The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3_1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo_oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants.
Hybrids lose heterotic yield advantage when multiplied sexually via meiosis.
 A potential alternative breeding system for hybrids is apospory, where female gametes develop without meiosis.
 The cellular origin of AIs is obscure, but one possibility, suggested by the mac1 and msp1 mutants of maize and rice, is that AIs are apomeiotic derivatives of the additional MeMCs that appear when genetic control over sporocyte numbers is relaxed.
 Like mac1 and msp1, exs/ems1 mutants produce extra sporocytes in the anther instead of a tapetum, causing male sterility.
 Here we show that rice contains two TPD1_like genes, OsTDL1A and OsTDL1B.
 Both are co_expressed with MSP1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL1A and MSP1 are co_expressed in the ovule.
 OsTDL1A binds to the leucine_rich_repeat domain of MSP1 in yeast two_hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in onion cells; OsTDL1B lacks this capacity.
 When driven by the maize Ubiquitin1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL1A phenocopies msp1 in the ovule but not in the anther.
 Thus, RNAi produces multiple MeMCs without causing male sterility.
 We conclude that OsTDL1A binds MSP1 in order to limit sporocyte numbers.
 OsTudor_SN molecules occur as high_molecular_weight forms, the integrity of which are sensitive to RNase.
 Immunoprecipitation followed by RT_PCR showed that OsTudor_SN binds prolamine and glutelin RNAs.
 Examination of OsTudor_SN particles in transgenic rice plants expressing GFP_tagged prolamine RNA transport particles showed co_localization of OsTudor_SN and GFP, suggesting a role in RNA transport.
 Consistent with this view, GFP_tagged OsTudor_SN is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors.
 Downregulation of OsTudor_SN by antisense and RNAi resulted in a decrease in steady state prolamine RNA and protein levels, and a reduction in the number of prolamine protein bodies.
 Collectively, these results show that OsTudor_SN is a component of the RNA transport particle, and may control storage protein biosynthesis by regulating one or more processes leading to the transport, localization and anchoring of their RNAs to the cortical ER.
 Recent studies have suggested that endogenous siRNAs induce DNA methylation, chromatin modification and chromatin inactivation at homologous sequences.
 We have shown that siRNAs targeted to promoter regions of endogenous rice genes induce strong DNA methylation of the targeted sequences, but transcriptional gene silencing is rarely observed.
 Here, an analysis of epigenetic modifications induced by RNAi targeted to transcribed regions of endogenous rice genes shows that the effects of siRNA are gene_specific, but that they tend to induce higher de novo DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides than of other cytosines.
 However, loss of OsMet1 expression by RNAi did not significantly affect levels and patterns of de novo DNA methylation or post_transcriptional mRNA suppression.
 We also showed that sequence_specific de novo DNA methylation extended both 5¢ and 3¢ of the targeted sequences, but there was no significant extension of siRNA signals either 5¢ or 3¢.
 These results suggest that exogenous siRNAs are strong inducers of de novo DNA methylation in transcribed sequences of rice endogenous genes, but are insufficient to induce heterochromatin formation.
Yellowing, which is related to the degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll–protein complexes, is a notable phenomenon during leaf senescence.
 Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay_green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light_harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence.
 In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay_green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i.
 The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation.
 Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro.
 These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co_localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice.
 We report here the isolation and in_depth characterization of a brittle rice mutant, brittle culm 10 (bc10).
 bc10 plants show pleiotropic phenotypes, including brittleness of the plant body and retarded growth.
 The BC10 gene was cloned through a map_based approach, and encodes a Golgi_located type II membrane protein that contains a domain designated as ‘domain of unknown function 266’ (DUF266) and represents a multiple gene family in rice.
 BC10 has low sequence similarity with the domain to a core 2 b_1,6_N_acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), and its in vitro enzymatic activity suggests that it functions as a glycosyltransferase.
 Monosaccharide analysis of total and fractioned wall residues revealed that bc10 showed impaired cellulose biosynthesis.
 Immunolocalization and isolation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) in the wild_type and bc10 showed that the level of AGPs in the mutant is significantly affected.
 BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties.
 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced OsGSR1 expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility.
 The OsGSR1 RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide.
 The yeast two_hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24_methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis.
 These results suggest that OsGSR1 activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post_translational level.
 Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA.
Recent studies have shown that molecular control of inner floral organ identity appears to be largely conserved between monocots and dicots, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying development of the monocot outer floral organ, a unique floral structure in grasses.
 In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in EG1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls.
 EG1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia.
 We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg1.
 As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, EG1 reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty_glume fate and spikelet development.
Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is a serious viral pest that is transmitted to rice plants (Oryza sativa L, by leafhoppers and causes a dwarfism in infected plants.
 Co_segregation and complementation analyses revealed that the rim1_1 mutation had been caused by insertion of Tos17 in an intron of a novel NAC gene.
 We propose that RIM1 functions as a host factor that is required for multiplication of RDV in rice.
 Suppression of OsSPX1 by RNA interference resulted in severe signs of toxicity caused by the over_accumulation of Pi, similar to that found in OsPHR2 (phosphate starvation response transcription factor 2) overexpressors and pho2 (phosphate_responsive mutant 2).
 Quantitative RT_PCR showed that expression of OsSPX1 was strongly induced in OsPHR2 overexpression and pho2 mutant plants, indicating that OsSPX1 occurs downstream of OsPHR2 and PHO2.
 Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1_RNAi (OsSPX1_Ri) plants, suggesting that over_accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1_Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport.
 In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation_induced genes tested.
 Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (sp1), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short_panicle phenotype.
 Gene cloning and characterization indicate that SP1 encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family.
 This conclusion is based on the findings that SP1 contains a conserved PTR2 domain consisting of 12 transmembrane domains, and that the SP1_GFP fusion protein is localized in the plasma membrane.
 The SP1 gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of SP1 and the sp1 phenotype.
 Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter.
 However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant.
 OsVPE1 encodes a 497_amino_acid polypeptide.
 Like the wild_type protein, the mutant protein is sorted into vacuoles; however, the enzymatic activity of the mutant OsVPE1 is almost completely eliminated.
 Further, we show that OsVPE1 is incorrectly cleaved, resulting in a mature protein that is smaller than the wild_type mature protein.
 Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsVPE1 is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the maturation of rice glutelins.
 Further, OsVPE1 Cys269 is a key residue for maintaining the Asn_specific cleavage activity of OsVPE1.
Numerous genes are involved in the regulation of plant development, including those that regulate floral homeotic genes, We identified two recessive allelic rice mutants, open beak_1 (opb_1) and opb_2, which exhibited pleiotropic defects in leaf morphogenesis, inflorescence architecture, and floral organ identity.
 Abnormal cell proliferation was observed in the leaves and spikelets, and ectopic or overexpression of several class 1 knox genes was detected; thus, the abnormal cell proliferation in opb mutants is probably caused by ectopic class 1 knox gene expression.
 The opb mutants also had defects in floral organ identity, resulting in the development of mosaic organs, including gluminous lodicules, staminoid lodicules, and pistiloid stamens.
 These results, together with the reduced expression of a class B gene, indicate that OPB positively regulates the expression of class B genes.
 Map_based cloning revealed that OPB encodes a transcription factor that is orthologous to the Arabidopsis JAGGED gene and is expressed in leaf primordia, inflorescence meristem, rachis branch meristems, floral meristem, and floral organ primordia.
 Taken together, our data suggest that the OPB gene affects cellular proliferation and floral organ identity through the regulation of class 1 knox genes and floral homeotic genes.
 Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low_tillering (dlt) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map_based cloning.
 DLT encodes a new member of the plant_specific GRAS family.
 The dwarf phenotype of dlt is similar to BR_deficient or signaling mutants in rice.
 In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that dlt is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that DLT is involved in BR signaling.
 Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the dlt mutant indicated that DLT is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes.
 In addition, transcription of several other BR_regulated genes is altered in the dlt mutant.
 Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback_regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR_response element.
 Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron).
 pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2 – a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch_to_shoot conversion in the reproductive phase.
 However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology.
 Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly.
Meiosis is essential for eukaryotic sexual reproduction and important for genetic diversity among individuals.
 In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice.
 Two independent alleles, designated pair3_1 and pair3_2, were identified in our T_DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes.
 Suppression of PAIR3 by RNAi produced similar results to the T_DNA insertion lines.
 PAIR3 encodes a protein that contains putative coiled_coil motifs, but does not have any close homologs in other organisms.
 PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis.
 Our results suggest that PAIR3 plays a crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in meiosis.
We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, OsHDAC1, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth.
 To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of OsHDAC1 overexpression (OsHDAC1OE), a global profiling of root_expressed genes was performed on OsHDAC1OE or HDAC inhibitor_treated non_transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots.
 Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM_ATAF_CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression.
 The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock_out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1OE seedlings.
 Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock_out seedlings.
 These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1OE seedlings.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4.
 Their various phenotypes include delayed seed germination, retarded growth, dwarfism and sterility.
 This mutation, named opaque and growth retardation 1 (ogr1), was generated by T_DNA insertion into a gene that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein containing the DYW motif.
 Ectopic expression of OGR1 in the mutant complements the altered phenotypes.
 We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development.
Floral organ identity is defined by organ homoetic genes whose coordinated expression is crucial with respect to the time and place of floral organ formation.
 The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B_class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma_like organs and carpels.
 Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4.
 We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression.
 SL1 encodes a member of the C2H2 family of zinc finger proteins, closely related to JAG of Arabidopsis.
 The functional divergence between SL1 and JAG implies that SL1 was co_opted for its distinctive roles in specification of floral organ identity in rice after the lineage split from Arabidopsis.
Chlorophyll degradation is an important phenomenon in the senescence process.
 It is necessary for the degradation of certain chlorophyll–protein complexes and thylakoid membranes during leaf senescence.
Mutants retaining greenness during leaf senescence are known as ‘stay_green’ mutants.
 Non_functional type stay_green mutants, which possess defects in chlorophyll degradation, retain greenness but not leaf functionality during senescence.
 nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild_type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non_functional stay_green mutant.
 nyc3 shows a similar but weaker phenotype to stay green (sgr), another non_functional stay_green mutant in rice.
 The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr.
 Linkage analysis revealed that NYC3 is located near the centromere region of chromosome 6.
 Thus, it was revealed that NYC3 encodes a plastid_localizing a/b hydrolase_fold family protein with an esterase/lipase motif.
 The possible function of NYC3 in the regulation of chlorophyll degradation is discussed.
The rice (Oryza sativa L, basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo.
 To ascertain the functions of these trans_activators in seed development, knock_down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm_specific manner by co_suppression (KD_RISBZ1 and KD_RPBF).
 Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF.
 These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling.
 The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice.
 Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
Regenerated tdd1 plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes.
Antisense expression of OsHI_LOX (as_lox) reduced SSB_ or BPH_induced JA and trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) levels, improved the larval performance of SBB as well as that of the rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and increased the damage caused by SSB and LF larvae.
 These results imply that OsHI_LOX is involved in herbivore_induced JA biosynthesis, and plays contrasting roles in controlling rice resistance to chewing and phloem_feeding herbivores.
 We report here an in_depth characterization of a narrow leaf and dwarf1 (nd1) rice mutant that shows significant reduction in plant growth due to retarded cell division.
 Map_based cloning revealed that ND1 encodes OsCSLD4, one of five members of the CSLD sub_family in rice.
A pre_infestation of the white_backed planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera Horva´th, conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo) in rice (Oryza sativa L, under both laboratory and field conditions.
 Based on these data, we conclude that OsHPL2 and its derived (E)_2_hexenal play some role in WBPH_induced resistance in rice.
Although susceptibility to seed shattering causes severe yield loss during cereal crop harvest, it is an adaptive trait for seed dispersal in wild plants.
 Here, we further mapped sh_h to a 34_kb region on chromosome 7 by analyzing 240 F2 plants and five F3 lines from the cross between Hsh and Blue&Gundil.
 Two transferred DNA (T_DNA) insertion mutants and one point mutant exhibited the enhanced shattering phenotype, confirming that LOC_Os07g10690 is indeed the sh_h gene.
 These results demonstrate that OsCPL1 represses differentiation of the abscission layer during panicle development.
Mutant analyses in different eudicotyledonous flowering plants demonstrated that SEPALLATA_like MADSbox genes are required for the specification of sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, and for floral determinacy, thus defining class E floral organ identity genes.
 Plants affected in both OsMADS7 and OsMADS8 show severe phenotypes including late flowering, homeotic changes of lodicules, stamens and carpels into palea/lemma_like organs, and a loss of floral determinacy.
 Simultaneous knockdown of the four rice SEP_like genes OsMADS1, OsMADS5, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8, leads to homeotic transformation of all floral organs except the lemma into leaf_like organs.
 We also show that OsSIK1 affects stomatal density in the abaxial and adaxial leaf epidermis of rice.
 At the reproductive stage, positron_emitting tracer imaging system analysis revealed that Fe translocation to the shoots and seeds was suppressed in OsYSL2i.
 Furthermore, when OsYSL2 expression was driven by the sucrose transporter promoter, the Fe concentration in the polished rice was up to 4.
 These results indicate that the altered expression of OsYSL2 changes the localization of Fe, and that OsYSL2 is a critical Fe_nicotianamine transporter important for Fe translocation,especially in the shoots and endosperm.
The zebra_necrosis (zn) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) produces transversely green/yellow_striped leaves.
 Map_based cloning revealed that ZN encodes a thylakoid_bound protein of unknown function.
 Virus_induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development.
 In the PSII repair, the degradation of damaged D1 is not impaired, suggesting a reduced activity of new D1 synthesis, possibly because of higher levels of ROS generated from the Chl_free cells by excess light.
 Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness.
Plants recognize environmental factors to determine flowering time.
In rice, Hd1, an ortholog of CO, acts as a flowering promoter, and phytochromes repress Hd1 expression.
 OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days.
 In contrast, OsCOL4 activation_tagging mutants (OsCOL4_D) flowered late in either environment.
 Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants,but reduced in the OsCOL4_D mutants.
 This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1.
 By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4_D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways.
 In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants,indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB.
 We also present evidence for two independent pathways through which OsPhyB controls flowering time.
 Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm12 (BC12), a gene encoding a kinesin_4 protein.
 bc12 mutants display dwarfism resulting from a significant reduction in cell number and brittleness due to an alteration in cellulose microfibril orientation and wall composition.
 BC12 is expressed mainly in tissues undergoing cell division and secondary wall thickening.
 In vitro biochemical analyses verified BC12 as an authentic motor protein.
 This protein was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and associated with microtubule arrays during cell division.
 Mitotic microtubule array comparison, flow cytometric analysis and expression assays of cyclin_dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in root_tip cells showed that cell_cycle progression is affected in bc12 mutants.
 BC12 is very probably regulated by CDKA;3 based on yeast two_hybrid and microarray data.
 Therefore, BC12 functions as a dual_targeting kinesin protein and is implicated in cell_cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and wall composition in the monocot plant rice.
 The coe1 mutants had short commissural vein (CV) intervals and produced clustered CVs.
 Application of 1_N_naphthylphthalamic acid and brefeldin A decreased CV intervals, and application of 1_naphthaleneacetic acid increased CV intervals in wild_type rice; however, coe1 mutants were insensitive to these chemicals.
 COE1 encodes a leucine_rich repeat receptor_like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid_insensitive 1_associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane.
 Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation.
Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild_type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild_type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals.
 These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals.
 A plasma membrane glycoprotein, CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) and a receptor kinase, CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase) (also known as LysM_RLK1), were identified as critical components for chitin signaling in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively.
 Knockdown of OsCERK1 resulted in marked suppression of the defense responses induced by chitin oligosaccharides, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for chitin signaling in rice.
 The results of a yeast two_hybrid assay indicated that both CEBiP and OsCERK1 have the potential to form hetero_ or homo_oligomers.
 Immunoprecipitation using a membrane preparation from rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharides suggested the ligand_induced formation of a receptor complex containing both CEBiP and OsCERK1.
 Blue native PAGE and chemical cross_linking experiments also suggested that a major portion of CEBiP exists as homo_oligomers even in the absence of chitin oligosaccharides.
Here, we report that the perception of CE by CEBiP contributes to disease resistance against the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and that enhanced responses to CE by engineering CEBiP increase disease tolerance.
 Knockdown of CEBiP expression allowed increased spread of the infection hyphae.
 To enhance defense responses to CE, we constructed chimeric genes composed of CEBiP and Xa21, which mediate resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight.
 The expression of either CRXa1 or CRXa3, each of which contains the whole extracellular portion of CEBiP, the whole intracellular domain of XA21, and the transmembrane domain from either CEBiP or XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after treatment with CE.
 These results suggest that CEs are produced and recognized through the LysM domain of CEBiP during the interaction between rice and M.
 oryzae and imply that engineering pattern recognition receptors represents a new strategy for crop protection against fungal diseases.
 Pb1_mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation.
 We isolated the Pb1 gene by map_based cloning.
 The Pb1 protein sequence differed from previously reported R_proteins, particularly in the NBS domain, in which the P_loop was apparently absent and some other motifs were degenerated.
 Pb1 was located within one of tandemly repeated 60_kb units, which presumably arose through local genome duplication.
 Pb1 transcript levels increased during the development of Pb1+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance.
 Here, we report that OsMADS6 is highly expressed in flower and endosperm in Oryza sativa (rice).
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)_PCR analyses on the chromatin of the OsMADS6 gene find that H3K27 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is silenced, and that H3K36 is trimethylated in tissues where OsMADS6 is highly activated.
 Point mutation analysis reveals that leucine at position 83 is critical to OsMADS6 function.
 Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the gpa1 endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures.
 Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the gpa1 endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis_targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted.
 The gene corresponding to the gpa1 mutation was found to be OsRab5a, which encodes a small GTPase.
 Strikingly, the rice genome contains a biosynthetic gene cluster for momilactone production, located on rice chromosome 4, which contains two cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono_oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock_down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation.
 Here we attempted biochemical characterization of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, which was ultimately achieved by complete gene recoding, enabling functional recombinant expression in bacteria.
 With these synthetic gene constructs it was possible to demonstrate that while CYP99A2 does not exhibit significant activity with diterpene substrates, CYP99A3 catalyzes consecutive oxidations of the C19 methyl group of the momilactone precursor syn_pimara_7,15_diene to form, sequentially,syn_pimaradien_19_ol, syn_pimaradien_19_al, and syn_pimaradien_19_oic acid.
 In addition, we found that CYP99A3 also oxidized syn_stemod_13(17)_ene at C19 to produce, sequentially, syn_stemoden_19_ol, syn_stemoden_19_al, and synstemoden_19_oic acid, albeit with lower catalytic efficiency than with syn_pimaradiene.
 Although the CYP99A3 syn_stemodene_derived products were not detected in planta, these results nevertheless provide a hint at the currently unknown metabolic fate of this diterpene in rice.
 Regardless of any wider role, our results strongly indicate that CYP99A3 acts as a multifunctional diterpene oxidase in momilactone biosynthesis.
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is associated with a mitochondrial mutation that causes an inability to produce fertile pollen.
 The fertility of CMS plants is restored in the presence of a nuclear_encoded fertilityrestorer (Rf) gene.
 In Lead Rice_type CMS, discovered in the indica variety ‘Lead Rice’, fertility of the CMS plant is restored by the single nuclear_encoded gene Rf2 in a gametophytic manner.
Expression of Rf2 mRNA was detected in developing and mature anthers.
 Replacement of isoleucine by threonine at amino acid 78 of the RF2 protein was considered to be the cause of functional loss in the rf2 allele.
 As Rf2 does not encode a pentatricopeptide repeat protein, unlike a majority of previously identified Rf genes, the data from this study provide new insights into the mechanism for restoring fertility in CMS.
Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen.
 To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm_specific manner.
 Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over_expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight.
 Microarray and RT_PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co_chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line.
 Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild_type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase_like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype.
 Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.
 Here, we report the results of a study using a functional genomics approach that identified a rice basic helix_loop_helix domain gene, OsbHLH148, that conferred drought tolerance as a component of the jasmonate signaling module in rice.
 Transgenic over_expression of OsbHLH148 in rice confers plant tolerance to drought stress.
 Expression profiling followed by DNA microarray and RNA gel_blot analyses of transgenic versus wild_type rice identified genes that are up_regulated by OsbHLH148 over_expression.
 OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein,interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two_hybrid and pull_down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine.
 These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148_related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance.
 Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate_regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148–OsJAZ–OsCOI1 signaling module in rice.
 Exogenous challenge of detached rice leaves with 1% MeOH accelerated Trp and serotonin biosynthesis with induction of the corresponding genes.
 Endogenous overproduction or suppression of MeOH either by PME1 overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing revealed that PME1 overexpressing lines produced twofold higher Trp levels with elevated Trp biosynthetic gene expression, whereas RNAi lines showed twofold reduction in Trp level in healthy control rice leaves, suggesting that MeOH acts as an endogenous elicitor to enhance Trp biosynthesis.
 Among many transcription factors induced following MeOH treatment, the WRKY family showed significant induction patterns, of which WRKY14 appeared to play a key regulatory role in MeOH_induced Trp and Trp_derived secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR_Pia avirulence gene.
 By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3–Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes.
 We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)_treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar ‘Sasanishiki’ harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype.
 The wild_type ‘Sasanishiki’ allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function.
 However, when the rice cultivar ‘Himenomochi’ lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered.
 An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS_LRR_type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function.
 Of the three genes encoding cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 is critical for normal growth and grain filling.
 To address this issue, we carried out quantitative comparative analyses between the metabolite profiles of a rice mutant lacking OsGS1;1 and its background wild type (WT).
Overaccumulation of free ammonium in the leaf sheath and roots of the mutant indicated the importance of OsGS1;1 for ammonium assimilation in both organs.
 Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT_like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome).
 On the other hand, under long_day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT_like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 – a unique pathway in rice.
 We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild_type plants,particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the Hd1_deficient background.
 Map_based cloning revealed that Ehd3 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a putative transcriptional regulator with two plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motifs.
 To identify the role of Ehd3 within the gene regulatory network for rice flowering, we compared the transcript levels of genes related to rice flowering in wild_type plants and ehd3 mutants.
Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FTlike genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction.
 Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7_independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1.
 Our results demonstrate that the PHD_finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice.
 oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very_long_chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination.
 ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs.
 This study demonstrates that root hair_specific expansin As, a sub_clade of the cell wall_loosening expansin proteins, are required for root hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
In this study, we characterized the semi_dominant mutant nls1_1D (necrotic leaf sheath 1) of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern.
 nls1_1D plants also exhibited constitutively activated defense responses, including extensive cell death, excess hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, up_regulated expressions of pathogenesis_related genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens.
 The nls1_1D mutation causes a S367N substitution in the non_conserved region close to the GLPL motif of the NB domain.
 In addition,because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of nls1_1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that NLS1 mediates both SA and NPR1_independent defense signaling pathways in rice.
Cytokinin is known to have negative effects on de novo auxin_induced root formation.
 In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (crl5), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia.
 The expression of CRL5, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs.
 Exogenous auxin treatment induced CRL5 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, which also required the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins.
 A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation.
 A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation.
Shugoshin is a conserved protein in eukaryotes that protects the centromeric cohesin of sister chromatids from cleavage by separase during meiosis.
 During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase.
 In the Tos17_insertional Ossgo1_1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II.
 Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1_1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis.
 Furthermore, the timely assembly and maintenance of synaptonemal complexes during early prophase I are affected in Ossgo1 mutants.
 Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1.
 RGB1 knock_down lines were generated in the wild type and d1_5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein a_subunit (Ga) gene (RGA1).
 Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1_5.
 The RGB1 knock_down lines generated in d1_5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1.
 The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock_down lines.
 These results suggest that Gbc and Ga cooperatively function in cellular proliferation and seed fertility.
 We discuss the potential predominant role of RGB1 in G protein signaling in rice.
Although the quiescent center (QC) is crucial to root development, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its postembryonic maintenance remain obscure.
 In this study, a semi_dominant mutant that exhibits pleiotropic defects in root tissues, which includes the root cap, lateral and crown roots, was isolated.
 The mutant is characterized by a loss of QC identity during postembryonic development, and the displayed defects result from a stabilizing mutation in domain II of OsIAA23 (Os06g39590).
 Expression of OsIAA23 is specific to the QC of the root tip during the development of primary, lateral and crown roots.
 Consistent with OsIAA23 expression in the QC, the auxin signaling marked by DR5p.
 In rice (Oryza sativa), the GF14e gene, which encodes a 14_3_3 protein, is induced during effector_triggered immunity (ETI) associated with pathogens such as Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 To determine whether the GF14e gene plays a direct role in resistance to disease in rice, we suppressed its expression by RNAi silencing.
 GF14e suppression was correlated with the appearance of a lesion_mimic (LM) phenotype in the transgenic plants at 3 weeks after sowing.
 This indicates inappropriate regulation of cell death, a phenotype that is frequently associated with enhanced resistance to pathogens.
 Enhanced resistance was correlated with GF14e silencing prior to and after development of the LM phenotype, higher basal expression of a defense response peroxidase gene (POX22.
 Together, our findings suggest that GF14e negatively affects the induction of plant defense response genes, cell death and broad_spectrum resistance in rice.
 NdhK was not detected by Western blot analysis in crr6 mutants, resulting in lack of a transient post_illumination increase in chlorophyll fluorescence, and confirming that crr6 mutants lack NDH activity.
 800 lmol photons m)2 sec)1), were similar between crr6 mutants and control plants.
 However, when plants were grown at 20C, all the examined photosynthetic parameters were significantly lower in crr6 mutants than control plants, and this effect on photosynthesis caused a corresponding reduction in plant biomass.
 The Fv/Fm ratio was only slightly lower in crr6 mutants than in control plants after short_term strong light treatment at 20C.
 However, after long_term acclimation to the low temperature, impairment of cyclic electron flow suppressed non_photochemical quenching and promoted reduction of the plastoquinone pool in crr6 mutants.
 We reported previously that leaf chlorosis in the v1 mutant is caused by blockage of the activation of the chloroplast genetic system during early leaf development.
 Here we identify the V1 gene, which encodes a chloroplast_localized protein NUS1.
 In the leaves of the NUS1_deficient mutant, accumulation of chloroplast rRNA during early leaf development was impaired and chloroplast translation/transcription capacity was severely suppressed under low temperature.
Our results suggest that NUS1 is involved in the regulation of chloroplast RNA metabolism and promotes the establishment of the plastid genetic system during early chloroplast development under cold stress conditions.
 Here we characterized the functions of a gene, OsFRDL4 (Os01g0919100) that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family in rice (Oryza sativa).
 Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocyte showed that the OsFRDL4 protein was able to transport citrate and was activated by Al.
 The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure.
Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2_type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance.
 Transient expression of OsFRDL4 in onion epidermal cells showed that it localized to the plasma membrane.
 Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip.
 These expression patterns and cell specificity of localization of OsFRDL4 are different from other MATE members identified previously.
 Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild_type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap.
 Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance.
 Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al_induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice.
 Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants.
 The level of H2O2 accumulation was greater in oscpk12 and OsCPK12 RNAi plants than in the WT.
 These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS.
 We also observed that OsCPK12_OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway.
 Collectively, our results suggest that OsCPK12 functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance.
 The Oryza sativa (rice) transcription factor IDEF1 plays a crucial role in regulating iron deficiency_induced genes involved in iron homeostasis.
 In the present report, we found characteristic histidine–asparagine repeat and proline_rich regions in IDEF1 and its homolog in Hordeum vulgare (barley), HvIDEF1.
 An immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography assay revealed that IDEF1 and HvIDEF1 bind to various divalent metals, including Fe2+and Ni2+.
 Recombinant IDEF1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli contained mainly Fe and Zn.
 This metalbinding activity of IDEF1 was almost abolished by deletion of the histidine–asparagine and proline_rich regions, but DNA_binding and trans_activation functions were not impaired by the deletion.
 Transgenic rice plants constitutively overexpressing IDEF1 without these metal_binding domains failed to cause pleiotropic effects conferred by overexpression of full_length IDEF1, including a low germination rate, impaired seedling growth,tolerance to iron deficiency in hydroponic culture, and enhanced expression of various iron deficiencyinducible genes.
 Impairment of the transcriptional regulation of IDEF1 by deletion of the metal_binding domains occurred primarily at an early stage of iron deficiency.
 These results suggest that the histidine–asparagine and proline_rich regions in rice IDEF1 directly bind to divalent metals and sense the cellular metal ion balance caused by changes in iron availability.
 The apo2 mutants also display a shortened plastochron in the vegetative phase, late flowering, aberrant floral organ identities and loss of floral meristem determinacy.
 Map_based cloning revealed that APO2 is identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene.
 Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems.
 In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant.
 Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio_temporal expression of B_ and E_function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules.
 Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels, and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1.
 By deep sequencing of small RNAs from different tissues of the wild type and osdcl4_1,we revealed that the processing of 21_nucleotide siRNAs, including trans_acting siRNAs (tasiRNA) and over 1000 phased small RNA loci, was largely dependent on OsDCL4.
 Surprisingly, the processing of 24_nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family.
 Furthermore, the accumulation of the two triggering miRNAs requires OsDCL1 activity.
Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21_ and 24_nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice.
 Docs1 was isolated by map_based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots.
 Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers.
 Immunostaining with an anti_Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region.
 Furthermore, Docs1 showed polar localization at the distal side.
 Subcellular examination showed that Docs1 was localized to the plasma membrane.
 These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice.
 This phenotypic resemblance and phylogenetic analysis suggest functional conservation of STR1 and STR2 across the angiosperms.
 Malnutrition of the fungus underlying limited arbuscular growth was excluded by the absence of complementation of the str1 phenotype by wild_type nurse plants.
 Furthermore, plant AM signaling was found to be intact, as arbuscule_induced marker transcript accumulation was not affected in str1 mutants.
 Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2.
 However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2.
 Interestingly, rice STR1 is associated with a cis_natural antisense transcript (antiSTR1).
 Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice.
 Here, we show that DNA damage neither down_regulates Orysa;CDKB2;1 nor induces endoreduplication in rice.
 Furthermore, we found increased levels of Orysa;CDKB2;1 protein upon DNA damage.
In addition, polyploid cells due to endomitosis were present in CDKB2;1 knockdown rice, suggesting an important role for Orysa;CDKB2;1 during mitosis.
 Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice,aberrant spikelet and panicle1 (asp1), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and disarrangement of phyllotaxy.
 OsSWAP70A interacted with rice Rho GTPase OsRac1, an important signaling factor for immune responses.
 The DH domain of OsSWAP70A exhibited the GEF_catalytic activity toward OsRac1 as found in animal Rho GEFs, indicating that plants have the functional DH domains.
 Transient expression of OsSWAP70A enhanced OsRac1_mediated production of reactive oxygen species in planta.
Reduction of OsSWAP70A and OsSWAP70B mRNA levels by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of chitin elicitor_induced defense gene expression and ROS production.
Recent methylome analyses of the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome using various mutants have provided detailed information about the DNA methylation pattern and its function.
 However, information about DNA methylation in other plants is limited, partly because of the lack of mutants.
 To study DNA methylation in rice (Oryza sativa) we applied homologous recombination_mediated gene targeting to generate targeted  disruptants of OsDRM2, a rice orthologue of DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/2), which encode DNA methyltransferases responsible for de novo and non_CG methylation in Arabidopsis.
 Whereas Arabidopsis drm1 drm2 double mutants showed no morphological alterations, targeted disruptants of rice OsDRM2 displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes in both vegetative and reproductive stages, including growth defects, semi_dwarfed stature, reductions in tiller number, delayed heading or no heading, abnormal panicle and spikelet morphology, and complete sterility.
 In these osdrm2 disruptants, a 13.
 Furthermore, de novo methylation by an RNA_directed DNA methylation (RdDM) process involving transgene_derived exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA) was deficient in osdrm2_disrupted cells.
 Impaired growth and abnormal DNA methylation of osdrm2 disruptants were restored by the complementation of wild_type OsDRM2 cDNA.
 Our results suggest that OsDRM2 is responsible for de novo, CG and non_CG methylation in rice genomic sequences, and that DNA methylation regulated by OsDRM2 is essential for proper rice development in both vegetative and reproductive stages.
 Here, our functional characterization of Arabidopsis and rice obgc mutants strongly underlines the evolutionarily conserved role of eukaryotic Obgs in organellar ribosome biogenesis.
 The mutants exhibited a chlorotic phenotype, caused by retarded chloroplast development.
 A plastid DNA macroarray revealed a plastid_encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) deficiency in an obgc mutant, caused by incompleteness of the PEP complex, as its western blot exhibited reduced levels of RpoA protein, a component of PEP.
 Plastid rRNA profiling indicated that plastid rRNA processing is defective in obgc mutants, probably resulting in impaired ribosome biogenesis and, in turn, in reduced levels of RpoA protein.
 RNA co_immunoprecipitation revealed that ObgC specifically co_precipitates with 23S rRNA in vivo.
 These findings indicate that ObgC functions primarily in plastid ribosome biogenesis during chloroplast development.
 Furthermore, complementation analysis can provide new insights into the functional modes of three ObgC domains, including the Obg fold, G domain and OCT.
Tiller initiation and panicle development are important agronomical traits for grain production in Oryza sativa L.
 The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield.
 The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi_dwarfism.
 Interestingly, LGD1 encodes multiple transcripts with different transcription start sites (TSSs), which were validated by RNA ligase_mediated rapid amplification of 5¢ and 3¢ cDNA ends (RLM_RACE).
 LGD1 encoding a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain containing protein is a single gene in rice that is seemingly specific to grasses.
 GFP_tagged LGD1 isoforms were predominantly detected in the nucleus, and weakly in the cytoplasm.
 In vitro northwestern analysis showed the RNA_binding activity of the recombinant C_terminal LGD1 protein.
 Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity.
 Hence, the study of LGD1 will strengthen our understanding of the molecular basis of the multiple transcripts, and their corresponding polypeptides with RNA binding activity, that regulate pleiotropic effects in rice.
 To test this empirically we transformed rice to possess higher (overexpressors, OE) and lower (RNA interference, RNAi) levels of expression of the regulatory psbS gene and analysed CO2 assimilation in transformants in a fluctuating measurement light regime.
 Western blots showed a several_fold difference in levels of PsbS protein between RNAi and OE plants with the wild type (WT) being intermediate.
 The PsbS content had a significant impact on qE (measured here as non_photochemical quenching, NPQ) but the strongest effect was observed transiently, immediately following the application of light.
 The loss of tasiR_mediated repression of ARFs in osrdr6_1 can explain its morphological defects, as expression of two non_targeted ARF3 gene constructs (ARF3muts) in a wild_type background mimics the osrdr6 and osdcl4_1 mutant phenotypes.
 Our work uncovers the key roles of OsRDR6 in small RNA biogenesis and directly illustrates the crucial functions of tasiR_ARFs in rice development.
 Four independent mutants of OsCOM1 were isolated and characterized.
 In Oscom1 mutants, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination were severely inhibited, whereas aberrant non_homologous chromosome entanglements occurred constantly.
 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal.
 Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11_1RNAi plants.
 These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.
 A biochemical assay revealed that OsHPL3 possesses intrinsic HPL activity, hydrolyzing hydroperoxylinolenic acid to produce GLVs.
 OsHPL3 positively modulates resistance to the rice brown planthopper [BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Sta˚l)] but negatively modulates resistance to the rice striped stem borer [SSB, Chilo suppressalis (Walker)].
 Interestingly, hpl3_1 plants also showed increased resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae).
 In this study we report the isolation and functional characterization of two rice genes OsVIT1 and OsVIT2, orthologs of the Arabidopsis VIT1.
 A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale_green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development.
 The photosynthetic rate in the mpr25 mutant was significantly decreased, especially under strong light conditions, although the respiration rate did not differ from that of wild_type plants.
 MPR25 was preferentially expressed in leaves.
 FLAG_tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts.
 Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C–U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria.
 Recombinant MPR25 directly interacted with the proximal region of the editing site of nad5 transcripts.
 The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts.
 The tissue_specific expression patterns of OsPIN3t were also investigated using a b_glucuronidase (GUS) reporter, which showed that OsPIN3t was mainly expressed in vascular tissue.
 We isolated a rice mutant nglf_1 with reduced plant height, small panicle and grain size, and low seed_setting rate (10% in nglf_1 compared to 93% in wild_type).
 The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by expression of a wild_type OsARG transgene.
 Over_expression of OsARG in rice (cv.
 Kitaake) increased grain number per plant under nitrogen_limited conditions.
 OsARG was ubiquitously expressed in various organs, but most strongly in developing panicles.
 The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases.
 Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen.
 OsARG is a potential target for crop improvement.
Phyllotaxy is defined as the spatial arrangement of leaves on the stem.
 The dec mutants had an enlarged shoot apical meristem with enhanced cell division activity.
 In contrast to the shoot apical meristem, the size of the root apical meristem in the dec mutants was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed.
 These phenotypes indicate that DEC has opposite functions in the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem.
 Map_based cloning revealed that DEC encodes a plant_specific protein containing a glutamine_rich region and a conserved motif.
 Expression analysis showed that several type A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin signaling pathway were down_regulated in the dec mutant.
 In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous cytokinin.
 Our results suggest that DEC controls the phyllotactic pattern by affecting cytokinin signaling in rice.
 DDF1 controls organ size by regulating both cell division and cell expansion.
 DDF1 encodes an F_box protein anchored in the nucleolus, and is expressed in almost all vegetative and reproductive tissues.
 Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B_class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL.
 In addition, DDF1 also negatively regulates the Arabidopsis LFY ortholog APO2, implying a functional connection between DDF1 and APO2.
 Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the OsIRL gene and protein were shown to be down_regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
 The OsIRL transcript level in rice suspension_cultured cells was also found to be induced by oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ferric chloride (FeCl3), methyl viologen (MV) and glucose/glucose oxidase (G/GO), but down_regulated when co_treated with GSH.
 Furthermore, to investigate whether overexpression of OsIRL in transgenic rice plants promotes resistance to ROS, we generated transgenic rice lines overexpressing the OsIRL gene under an abscisic acid (ABA) inducible promoter.
 Results showed that the OsIRL transgenic rice line activated by ABA treatment was tolerant against MV and G/GO_induced stress in rice leave and suspension_cultured cells.
 Our results strongly suggest the involvement of OsIRL in homeostasis of ROS.
 This paper tested the hypothesis that overexpression (OX) of GS1 in rice improves utilization N use efficiency (UtE = spikelet yield/shoot N content).
 Three GS1 OX lines were identified using activity assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
 Thus, N partitioning in rice during grain filling could be altered by GS1 OX, resulting in improved UtE.
 In our study, three rice homologous genes, OsNPR1/NH1, OsNPR2/NH2 and OsNPR3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae and rice blast Magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene.
 We confirmed that OsNPR1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant.
 Over_expression of OsNPR1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants.
 Different subcellular localizations of OsNPR1 antagonistically regulated SA_ and jasmonic acid (JA)_responsive genes, but not SA and JA levels, indicating that OsNPR1 might mediate antagonistic cross_talk between the SA_ and JA_dependent pathways in rice.
 Therefore, to effectively suppress phytic acid biosynthesis, antisense RINO1 cDNA was expressed under the control of the Ole18 promoter, directing the same spatial pattern in seeds as RINO1 in transgenic rice plants.
In rice (Oryza sativa L,, the number of panicles, spikelets per panicle and grain weight are important components of grain yield.
 We have previously map_cloned a gene cluster including eight leucine_rich repeat receptor_like kinase (LRK) genes in Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff,, which increased the grain yield by 16%.
 In the present study, we characterized the LRK1 gene, which was contained in the donor parent (Dongxiang wild rice) genome and absent from the recurrent parent genome (Guichao2, Oryza sativa L.
 Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms.
 The over_expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27.
09% increase in total grain yield per plant.
 Our data suggest that rice LRK1 regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation.
 The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops.
Generating a new variety of plant with erect_leaf is a critical strategy to improve rice grain yield, as plants with this trait can be dense_planted.
 Here, we identified OsBAK1 as a potential gene to alter rice architecture.
 Phylogenetic analysis and suppression of a weak Arabidopsis mutant bri1_5 indicated that OsBAK1 (Os08g0174700) is the closest relative of AtBAK1.
 Genetic, physiological, and biochemical analyses all suggest that the function of OsBAK1 is conserved with AtBAK1.
 The expression of OsBAK1 changed important agricultural traits of rice such as plant height, leaf erectness, grain morphologic features, and disease resistance responses.
 Therefore, OsBAK1 is a potential molecular breeding tool for improving rice grain yield by modifying rice architecture.
 Eight genes that conferred resistance to Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis have been introduced into rice for overexpression, and transformants were evaluated for resistance to the rice bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 One of the transgenic rice lines was highly resistant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 Interestingly, this line also showed remarkably high resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast, which is the most devastating rice disease in many countries.
 Here, we describe a curled leaf and dwarf mutant, cd1, in rice, which exhibits multiple phenotypic traits such as the reduction of plant height and leaf width, curled leaf morphology and a decrease in the number of grains and in the panicle length.
 RNAi transgenic plants with the candidate CSLD gene display a similar phenotype to the cd1 mutant, suggesting that OsCD1 is a member of the CSLD subfamily.
 Furthermore, sequence analysis indicates that OsCD1 contains the common D,D,D,QXXRW motif, which is a feature of the cellulose synthase_like super_family.
 Analysis of OsCD1 promoter with GUS fusion expression shows that OsCD1 exhibits higher expression in young meristem tissues such as fresh roots, young panicle and stem apical meristem.
 Cell wall composition analysis reveals that cellulose content and the level of xylose are significantly reduced in mature culm owing to loss of OsCD1 function.
 Take together, the work presented here is useful for expanding the understanding of cell wall biosynthesis.
Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 We report herein an in_depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture.
 The grain yield per plant in mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful potential for high grain yield in rice breeding.
 RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in the branch primordial region.
 Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that LP might be involved in ER_associated protein degradation (ERAD).
 Using yeast two_hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we confirm that LP is an F_box protein and could interact with rice SKP1_like protein in an F_box domain_dependent manner.
 Quantitative real_time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase ⁄ dehydrogenase, is down_regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues.
 These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants.
Crop architecture parameters such as tiller number, angle and plant height are important agronomic traits that have been considered for breeding programmes.
 Here, we report that over_expression of OsPIN2 through a transgenic approach in rice (Japonica cv.
 Nipponbare) led to a shorter plant height, more tillers and a larger tiller angle when compared with wild type (WT).
As an important agronomic trait, leaf rolling in rice (Oryza sativa L, has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders.
 Moderate leaf rolling increases the amount of photosynthesis in cultivars and hence raises grain yield.
 rl14 mutant plants had incurved leaves because of the shrinkage of bulliform cells on the adaxial side.
 In addition, rl14 mutant plants displayed smaller stomatal complexes and decreased transpiration rates, as compared with the wild type.
 RL14 was transcribed in sclerenchymatous cells in leaves that remained wrapped inside the sheath.
 In mature leaves, RL14 accumulated mainly in the mesophyll cells that surround the vasculature.
 Expression of genes related to secondary cell wall formation was affected in rl14_1 mutants, and cellulose and lignin content were altered in rl14_1 leaves.
 These results reveal that the RL14 gene affects water transport in leaves by affecting the composition of the secondary cell wall.
High temperature impairs rice (Oryza sativa) grain filling by inhibiting the deposition of storage materials such as starch, resulting in mature grains with a chalky appearance, currently a major problem for rice farming in Asian countries.
 Here we report the involvement of a starch_hydrolyzing enzyme, a_amylase, in high temperature_triggered grain chalkiness.
 As the extent of the decrease in chalky grains was highly correlated to decreases in the expression of Amy1A, Amy1C, Amy3A and Amy3B, these genes would be involved in the chalkiness through degradation of starch accumulating in the developing grains.
 The results show that activation of a_amylase by high temperature is a crucial trigger for grain chalkiness and that its suppression is a potential strategy for ameliorating grain damage from global warming.
 Here, an activation_tagging mutant Ostil1 (Oryza sativa tillering1) was characterized, which showed increased tillers, enlarged tiller angle and semidwarf phenotype.
 Transgenic rice overexpressing the OsNAC2 resulted in recapture of the mutant phenotype, while downregulation of OsNAC2 in the Ostil1 mutant through RNA interfering (RNAi) complemented the mutant phenotype, confirming that the Ostil1 was caused by overexpression of OsNAC2.
 Overexpression of OsNAC2 contributes tiller bud outgrowth, but does not affect tiller bud initiation.
 Here, characterization of rice (Oryza sativa) reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) mutants revealed that Rcn1 positively controls shoot branching by promoting the outgrowth of lateral shoots.
 Molecular studies revealed that Rcn1 encodes a novel member of ATP_binding cassette protein subfamily G (ABCG subfamily), also known as the white–brown complex (WBC) subfamily, and is designated OsABCG5.
 Rcn1 is expressed in leaf primordia of main and axillary shoots, and in the vascular cells and leaf epidermis of older leaves.
 In addition, Rcn1 is expressed in the crown root primordia, endodermis, pericycle and stele in the root.
 No effect on Rcn1 expression in shoots or roots was seen when the roots were treated with auxins.
 Phenotypic analyses of rcn1 and tillering dwarf 3 (d3) double mutants at the seedling stage clarified that Rcn1 works independently of D3 in the branching inhibitor pathway.
 Rcn1 is the first functionally defined plant ABCG protein gene that controls shoot branching and could thus be significant in future breeding for high_yielding rice.
To expand our understanding of cell death in plant defense responses, we isolated a novel rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf mutant (spl28) that displays a lesion mimic phenotype in the absence of pathogen attack through treatment of Hwacheongbyeo (an elite Korean japonica cultivar) with N_methyl_N_nitrosourea (MNU).
 However, after flowering, spl28 mutants exhibited a significant decrease in chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, and photosystem II efficiency, and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phytoalexin, callose, and autofluorescent phenolic compounds that localized in or around the lesions.
 The allele of OsHMA3 that confers high root_to_shoot Cd translocation rates (OsHMA3mc) encodes a defective P1B_ATPase transporter.
 OsHMA3 fused to green fluorescent protein was localized to vacuolar membranes in plants and yeast.
 An OsHMA3 transgene complemented Cd sensitivity in a yeast mutant that lacks the ability to transport Cd into vacuoles.
 Both Pik_1 and Pik_2 encode coiled_coil nucleotide binding site leucine_rich repeat (NBS_LRR) proteins, and each shares a very high level of protein identity with corresponding proteins encoded by the Pik_m and Pik_p alleles.
 OsSPR1 was identified by map_based cloning.
 Osspr1 mutants exhibited decreased root cell elongation.
 Complementation of the mutant confirmed that OsSPR1 is involved in post_embryonic root elongation and iron homeostasis in rice.
 OsSPR1 was found to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout the plant.
 The transcript abundance of various genes involved in iron uptake and signaling via both strategies I and II was similar in roots of wild_type and mutant plants, but was higher in the leaves of mutant plants.
 Thus, a novel mitochondrial protein that is involved in root elongation and plays a role in metal ion homeostasis has been identified.
 In this study, we employed two different genetic approaches, the use of siz1 T_DNA mutant and SIZ1_RNAi transgenic plants, to characterize the function of rice SIZ1.
 In addition to showing reduced plant height, tiller number and seed set percentage, both the siz1 mutant and SIZ1_RNAi transgenic plants showed obvious defects in anther dehiscence, but not pollen viability.
 The anther indehiscence in siz1 was probably a result of defects in endothecium development before anthesis.
 Interestingly, rice orthologs of AtIRX and ZmMADS2, which are essential for endothecium development during anther dehiscence, were significantly down_regulated in siz1.
 Compared with the wild_type, the sumoylation profile of high_molecular_weight proteins in mature spikelets was reduced significantly in siz1 and the SIZ1_RNAi line with notably reduced SIZ1 expression.
 The nuclear localization signal located in the SIZ1 C_terminus was sufficient for its nuclear targeting in bombarded onion epidermis.
 The results suggest the functional role of SIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase, in regulating rice anther dehiscence.
 Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA – OsARF12 – an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa).
 OsARF12 as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5.
 The anthers of mil2 mutants were characterized using molecular markers and cytological examination.
 The MIL2 gene was cloned and its expression pattern was analyzed through RNA in situ hybridization.
 The localization of the MIL2 protein was observed by immunostaining.
 MIL2 encodes the rice homolog of the Arabidopsis TAPETUM DETERMINANT1 (TPD1) protein.
 However, mil2 anthers display phenotypes different from those of tpd1 mutants, with only two layers of anther wall cells formed.
 MIL2 has an expression pattern distinct from that of TPD1.
Our results demonstrate that MIL2 is responsible for the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers, and suggest that rice and Arabidopsis anthers might share similar regulators in anther patterning, but divergent mechanisms are employed in these processes.
 The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein.
 OsSPX1 regulates OsSPX2, 3 and 5 at the transcription level and is positively involved in the responses of the genes to Pi_starvation.
 Overexpression of OsSPX3 downregulates OsSPX5 in shoots under Pi_sufficiency.
 OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi_starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi_starvation.
 Our results suggest that OsSPX1 may be a regulator involved in the transcriptions of OsSPX2, 3 and 5.
 OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2.
 Our results also indicate that OsSPX3 is involved in plant tolerance to Pi_starvation stress.
In the present paper, we identified and cloned OsDHODH1 encoding a putative cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in rice.
 Expression analysis indicated that OsDHODH1 is upregulated by salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold.
 By prokaryotic expression, we determined the enzymatic activity of OsDHODH1 and found that overproduction of OsDHODH1 significantly improved the tolerance of Escherichia coli cells to salt and osmotic stresses.
 Overexpression of the OsDHODH1 gene in rice increased the DHODH activity and enhanced plant tolerance to salt and drought stresses as compared with wild type and OsDHODH1_antisense transgenic plants.
 Our findings reveal, for the first time, that cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in plant stress response and that OsDHODH1 could be used in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought.
 Knockdown of OsPLDα1 prevented the NaCl_induced increase in the transcript level of OsVHA_A (encodes TP H+_ATPase) and OSA2 (encodes PM H+_ATPase), as well as OsNHX1 (encodes TP Na+/H+ antiporter).
Gelatinization temperature (GT) is an important parameter in evaluating the cooking and eating quality of rice.
 Previous map_based cloning revealed that GT was controlled by ALK gene, which encodes a putative soluble starch synthase II_3.
 Phenotypic and molecular analyses of transgenic lines provided direct evidence for ALK as a key gene for GT.
 Meanwhile, amylose content, gel consistency and pasting properties were also affected in transgenic lines.
 Two of four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in coding sequence of ALK were identified as essential for GT.
 We here show that overexpression of rice homeobox gene HOX1a resulted in enhanced gibberellin (GA) response, indicating a positive effect of HOX1a in GA signaling.
 HOX1a is induced by GA and encodes a homeobox transcription factor with transcription repression activity.
 In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (EL1), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of EL1 to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling.
 These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing EL1, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling.
 OsPAP10a belongs to group Ia of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), and clusters with the principal secreted PAPs in a variety of plant species including Arabidopsis.
 The transcript abundance of OsPAP10a is specifically induced by Pi deficiency and is controlled by OsPHR2, the central transcription factor controlling Pi homeostasis.
 In gel activity assays of root and shoot protein extracts, it was revealed that OsPAP10a is a major acid phosphatase isoform induced by Pi starvation.
 Constitutive overexpression of OsPAP10a results in a significant increase of phosphatase activity in both shoot and root protein extracts.
 In vivo root 5_bromo_4_chloro_3_indolyl_phosphate (BCIP) assays and activity measurements on external media showed that OsPAP10a is a root_associated APase.
 Furthermore, overexpression of OsPAP10a significantly improved ATP hydrolysis and utilization compared with wild type plants.
 These results indicate that OsPAP10a can potentially be used for crop breeding to improve the efficiency of P use.
 Based on map‐based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459‐bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)‐binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility.
 Expression analysis showed that OsABCG15 is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage).
 Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very‐long‐chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules.
 Consistently, histological analysis showed that osabcg15 mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores.
 The results suggest that OsABCG15 plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development, similar to the homologous gene of AtABCG26 in Arabidopsis.
 This work is helpful to understand the regulatory network in rice anther development.
 The OsRRMh dsRNAi lines exhibited late_flowering and a larger panicle phenotype.
 When full_length OsRRMh and/or its SPOC domain were overexpressed, the fertility rate and number of spikelets per panicle were both markedly reduced.
 Also, overexpression of OsRRMh in the Arabidopsis fpa mutant did not restore the normal flowering time, and it delayed flowering in Col plants.
 Therefore, we propose that OsRRMh may confer one of its functions in the vegetative_to_reproductive transition in rice (Oryza sativa L.
 By functional characterization of TOS17 retrotransposon_tagged Osjar1 plants and their response to simulated herbivory, we show that OsJAR1 is essential for JA_Ile production in herbivore_attacked, field_grown plants.
 In addition, OsJAR1 was required for normal seed development in rice under field conditions.
 Our results suggest that OsJAR1 possesses at least two major functions in rice defense and development that cannot be complemented by the additional OsJAR2 gene function, although this gene previously showed overlapping enzyme activity in vitro.
Grain size is an important yield‐related trait in rice.
 Intensive artificial selection for grain size during domestication is evidenced by the larger grains of most of today’s cultivars compared with their wild relatives.
 However, the molecular genetic control of rice grain size is still not well characterized.
 Here, we report the identification and cloning of Grain Size 6 (GS6), which plays an important role in reducing grain size in rice.
 A premature stop at the þ348 position in the coding sequence (CDS) of GS6 increased grain width and weight significantly.
 Alignment of the CDS regions of GS6 in 90 rice materials revealed three GS6 alleles.
 Further investigation of genetic diversity and the evolutionary mechanisms of GS6 showed that the GS6 gene was strongly selected in japonica cultivars.
 In addition, a “ggc” repeat region identified in the region that encodes the GRAS domain of GS6 played an important historic role in the domestication of grain size in rice.
 Knowledge of the function of GS6 might aid efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control grain development and evolution in rice plants, and could facilitate the genetic improvement of rice yield.
Mutations in the photorespiration pathway display a lethal phenotype in atmospheric air, which can be fully recovered by elevated CO2.
 An exception is that mutants of peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR1) do not have this phenotype, indicating the presence of cytosolic bypass in the photorespiration pathway.
 In this study, we constructed over_expression of the OsHPR1 gene and RNA interference plants of OsHPR1 and OsHPR2 genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.
 However, metabolite analysis and the SGAT activity assay showed that the metabolite flux of photorespiration was disturbed in RNAi lines of both HPR genes.
 The phenotype typical  of photorespiration mutants were observed only where activity of both HPR1 and HPR2 were down_regulated  in the same line.
 These findings demonstrate that two hydroxypyruvate reductases encoded by OsHPR1 and  OsHPR2 are involved in photorespiratory metabolism in rice.
 The overex_pression of Osoxo4 in rice did not show any detrimental phenotypic or agronomic effect.
 This work aims to define the action of IDD10 on gene expression involved in ammonium uptake and nitrogen (N) metabolism.
The ammonium induction of key ammonium uptake and assimilation genes was examined in the roots of idd10 mutants and IDD10 overexpressors.
In order to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice (Oryza sativa) organ development, we studied the narrow leaf2 narrow leaf3 (nal2 nal3; hereafter nal2/3) double mutant, which produces narrow_curly leaves, more tillers, fewer lateral roots, opened spikelets and narrow_thin grains.
 Opened spikelets, possibly caused by marginal deformity in the lemma, gave rise to narrow_thin grains.
 Map_based cloning revealed that NAL2 and NAL3 are paralogs that encode an identical OsWOX3A (OsNS) transcriptional activator, homologous to NARROW SHEATH1 (NS1) and NS2 in maize and PRESSED FLOWER in Arabidopsis.
 Expression levels of several leaf development_associated genes were altered in nal2/3, and auxin transport_related genes were significantly changed, leading to pin mutant_like phenotypes such as more tillers and fewer lateral roots.
 We applied MutMap_Gap to isolate the blast resistant gene Pii from the rice cv Hitomebore using mutant lines that have lost Pii function.
 In rice (Oryza sativa), transgenic herbicide resistance is expected to spread to conspecific weedy rice (Oryza sativa f.
 Controlling for genetic background, we examined physiological traits and field performance of crop–weed hybrid lineages that segregated for the presence or absence of this novel epsps transgene.
 Transgenic plants also had greater EPSPS protein levels, tryptophan concentrations, photosynthetic rates, and per cent seed germination compared with nontransgenic controls.
 Our findings suggest that over_expression of a native rice epsps gene can lead to fitness advantages, even without exposure to glyphosate.
 We hypothesize that over_expressed epsps may be useful to breeders and, if deployed, could result in fitness benefits in weedy relatives following transgene introgression.
 We report the isolation and characterization of a PcG member in rice, which was designated OsFIE2 for Oryza sativa Fertilization_Independent Endosperm 2.
 OsFIE2 is a single_copy gene in the rice genome and shows a universal expression pattern.
 The OsFIE2 RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic phenotypes in vegetative and reproductive organ generation.
 In unfertilized lines, endosperm formation could be triggered without embryo formation, which indicates that FIE is indeed involved in the suppression of autonomous endosperm development in rice.
 Furthermore, lateral root generation was promoted early in the roots of OsFIE2 RNAi lines, whereas the primary root was premature and highly differentiated.
 Our data suggest that the OsFIE2–PcG complex is vital for rice reproduction and endosperm formation.
 Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the osarf12 mutant and osarf12/25 double mutant with P_intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up_regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi_sufficient/_deficient (+Pi/Pi, 0.
 Transcript analysis revealed that Pi_responsive genes – Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P_1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1) – were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/Pi conditions.
 Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its down_stream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX_MFS1 and OsSPX_MFS2.
Selenite is a predominant form of selenium (Se) available to plants, especially in anaerobic soils, but the molecular mechanism of selenite uptake by plants is not well understood.
 ltn1, a rice mutant previously shown to have increased phosphate (Pi) uptake, was found to exhibit higher selenite uptake than the wild_type in both concentration_ and time_dependent selenite uptake assays.
 Respiratory inhibitors significantly inhibited selenite uptake in the wildtype and the ltn1 mutant, indicating that selenite uptake was coupled with H+ and energydependent.
 Selenite uptake was greatly enhanced under Pi_starvation conditions, suggesting that Pi transporters are involved in selenite uptake.
 OsPT2, the most abundantly expressed Pi transporter in the roots, is also significantly upregulated in ltn1 and dramatically induced by Pi starvation.
 OsPT2_overexpressing and knockdown plants displayed significantly increased and decreased rates of selenite uptake, respectively, suggesting that OsPT2 plays a crucial role in selenite uptake.
 These data strongly demonstrate that selenite and Pi share similar uptake mechanisms and that OsPT2 is involved in selenite uptake, which provides a potential strategy for breeding Seenriched rice varieties.
 Here, we report the influence of altered OsPTR9 expression on nitrogen utilization efficiency, growth, and grain yield.
 OsPTR9 expression is regulated by exogenous nitrogen and by the day_night cycle.
 Elevated expression of OsPTR9 in transgenic rice plants resulted in enhanced ammonium uptake, promotion of lateral root formation and increased grain yield.
 On the other hand, down_regulation of OsPTR9 in a T_DNA insertion line (osptr9) and in OsPTR9_RNAi rice plants had the opposite effect.
 These results suggest that OsPTR9 might hold potential for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and grain yield in rice breeding.
 We investigated a quantitative trait locus (QTL), qGP5_1, which is related to plant height, leaf size and panicle architecture, using a set of introgression lines of O.
 We cloned and characterized qGP5_ 1 and confirmed that the newly identified gene OsEBS (enhancing biomass and spikelet number) increased plant height, leaf size and spikelet number per panicle, leading to an increase in total grain yield per plant.
 Sequence alignment showed that OsEBS protein contains a region with high similarity to the N_terminal conserved ATPase domain of Hsp70, but it lacks the C_terminal regions of the peptide_binding domain and the C_terminal lid.
 More results indicated that OsEBS gene did not have typical characteristics of Hsp70 in this study.
 Furthermore, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transformed with OsEBS showed a similar phenotype to OsEBS_transgenic rice, indicating a conserved function of OsEBS among plant species.
 Together, we report the cloning and characterization of OsEBS, a new QTL that controls rice biomass and spikelet number, through map_based cloning, and it may have utility in improving grain yield in rice.
 The knockout of OsARF16 led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and _Pi response.
 OsARF16 expression and OsARF16.
Glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is a multi_protein complex, comprising P_, H_, T_ and L_protein subunits, which plays a major role in photorespiration in plants.
 Under high CO2, the OsGDCH RNA interference (OsGDCH_RNAi) plants grew normally, but under ambient CO2, severely suppressed OsGDCH_RNAi plants (SSPs) were non_viable, which displayed a photorespiration_deficient phenotype.
 Recently, we demonstrated that JA signalling has an important role in resistance to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 We examined the biochemical properties of OsJAR1 and its involvement in photomorphogenesis of rice (Oryza sativa).
 OsJAR1 has a similar substrate specificities as its orthologue in Arabidopsis.
 However, osjar1 loss_of_function mutants did not show as severe coleoptile phenotypes as the JA_deficient mutants coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, which develop long coleoptiles in all light qualities we examined.
 Analysis of hormonal contents in the young seedling stage revealed that osjar1 mutants are still able to synthesize JA_Ile conjugate in response to blue light, suggesting that a redundantly active enzyme can conjugate JA and Ile in rice seedlings.
 In contrast, if plants in the vegetative stage were mechanically wounded, the content of JA_Ile was severely reduced in osjar1, demonstrating that OsJAR1 is the most important JA_Ile conjugating enzyme in the wounding response during the vegetative stage.
 OsBURP16 belongs to the PG1β_like subfamily of BURP_family genes and encodes one putative PG1β subunit precursor in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 Transcription of OsBURP16 is induced by cold, salinity and drought stresses, as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
 Analysis of plant survival rates, relative ion leakage rates, accumulation levels of H2O2 and water loss rates of leaves showed that overexpression of OsBURP16 enhanced sensitivity to cold, salinity and drought stresses compared with controls.
 This severe dwarf phenotype, has short and dark green leaves, reduced shoot growth early in the seedling stage, and later severe dwarfism with failure to initiate flowering.
 Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene.
 The putative OsKS2 gene was a chromosome 4_located ent_kaurene synthase (KS), encoding the enzyme that catalyses an early step of the GA biosynthesis pathway.
 Sequence analysis revealed that osks2 carried a 1_bp deletion in the ORF region of OsKS2, which led to a loss_of_function mutation.
 The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild_type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs.
 We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants.
 Further investigation on OsKS2 and other OsKS_like proteins is underway and may yield better understanding of the putative role of OsKS in severe dwarf mutants.
The role of the sucrose transporter OsSUT1 in assimilate retrieval via the xylem, as a result of damage to and leakage from punctured phloem was examined after rusty plum aphid (Hysteroneura setariae, Thomas) infestation on leaves from 3_week_old rice (Oryza sativa L.
 qPCR and Western blot analyses revealed differential expression of OsSUT1 during aphid infestation.
Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme for photorespiration in plants.
 Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis have verified several epigenetic repressors that regulate flowering time.
 We identified a chromatin remodeling factor OsVIL2 (O.
 OsVIL2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a conserved motif of histone binding proteins.
 Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days.
 In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced.
 We demonstrated that OsVIL2 is bound to native histone H3 in vitro.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin.
 We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants.
 These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression.
 We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2.
 As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression.
 Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1.
 However, the molecular mechanism by which AIP1 promotes actin turnover remains largely unknown in plants.
 Here, we provide a demonstration that AIP1 promotes actin turnover, which is required for optimal growth of rice plants.
 Importantly, OsAIP1 acts coordinately with ADF and profilin to induce massive net actin depolymerization, indicating that AIP1 plays a major role in the turnover of actin, which is required to optimize F_actin levels in plants.
 As a well_characterized receptor kinase consisting of 23 tandem leucinerich repeats, a transmembrane domain and a serine/threonine kinase, the rice (Oryza sativa) protein XA21 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo) races that cause bacterial blight disease.
 We report here that XA21 binding protein 25 (XB25) belongs to the plant_specific ankyrinrepeat (PANK) family.
 XB25 physically interacts, in vitro, with the transmembrane domain of XA21 through its N–terminal binding to transmembrane and positively charged domain (BTMP) repeats.
 In addition, XB25 associates with XA21 in planta.
 The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21_mediated disease resistance at the adult stage.
 Moreover, the accumulation of XB25 is induced by Xoo infection.
 Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21_mediated disease resistance.
 Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post_seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content.
 Shoot regeneration and dark_induced leaf senescence assays indicated that the loss of GnTI function results in reduced sensitivity to cytokinin in rice.
 Yeast two_hybrid and in vitro pull_down results revealed an association between OsCYP2 and the co_chaperone Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 (OsSGT1).
 Our results suggest that OsCYP2 participates in auxin signal transduction by interacting with OsSGT1.
 Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST–OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds.
 We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
 oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues.
A mutation in the 9th exon of OsORC3 was responsible for the mutant phenotype.
 OsORC3 was strongly expressed in regions of active cell proliferation, including the primary root tip, stem base, lateral root primordium, emerged lateral root primordium, lateral root tip, young shoot, anther and ovary.
 OsORC3 knockdown plants lacked lateral roots and had a dwarf phenotype.
Yellowing/chlorophyll breakdown is a prominent phenomenon in leaf senescence, and is associated with the degradation of chlorophyll – protein complexes.
 From a rice mutant population generated by ionizing radiation, we isolated nyc4_1, a stay_green mutant with a defect in chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence.
 We extracted Os07g0558500 as a candidate for NYC4 via gene expression microarray analysis, and concluded from further evidence that disruption of the gene by a translocation_related event causes the nyc4 phenotype.
 Western blot analysis revealed that, in nyc4_1, the PSII core subunits D1 and D2 were significantly retained during leaf senescence in comparison with wild_type and other non_functional stay_green mutants, including sgr_2, a mutant of the key regulator of chlorophyll degradation SGR.
 The role of NYC4 in degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll – protein complexes during leaf senescence is discussed.
The embryo/endosperm size in mature seed differs among angiosperms to a high degree.
 GE function in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm.
 GE expression is under This article is protected by copyright.
negative feedback regulation; endogenous GE expression is up_regulated in ge mutants.
 In contrast to the loss_of_function mutant with large embryo and small endosperm, GE over_expression caused small embryo and enlarged endosperm.
 The complementation analysis coupled with heterofertilization showed that complementation of ge mutation in either embryo or endosperm failed to restore the wild_type embryo/endosperm ratio.
 Thus embryo and endosperm interact in determining embryo/endosperm size balance.
 Among genes associated with embryo/endosperm size, REDUCED EMBRYO genes, whose loss_of_function causes a phenotype opposite to ge, are revealed to regulate endosperm size upstream of GE.
Alteration of photoperiod sensitivity has let breeders diversify rice flowering time and develop cultivars adjusted to a range of growing season lengths.
 Map_based cloning revealed that a rice flowering_time QTL designed Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase I protein.
 One non_synonymous substitution in Hd16 resulted in decreased photoperiod sensitivity in rice, and this substitution occurred naturally in an old rice cultivar.
 By using near_isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering_time genes, we observed significant  digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering_time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2).
 In a near_isogenic line with the weak_photoperiod_sensitivity allele of Hd16, transcription levels of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 increased under long_day conditions, and  transcription levels of Hd3a and RFT1 decreased under short_day conditions.
 Expression analysis  under continuous light and dark conditions showed that Hd16 was not likely to be associated This article is protected by copyright.
 Biochemical characterization indicated that the functional Hd16 recombinant protein specifically phosphorylated Ghd7.
 These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of phosphorylation of Ghd7.
 Its expression, driven by a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in IR64 transgenic rice plants, confers salinity tolerance.
 The possible mechanism could be that OsSUV3 helicase functions in salinity stress tolerance by improving photosynthesis and antioxidant machinery in transgenic rice.
 OsMPS is induced by salt stress and expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues.
 Overexpression of OsMPS reduces growth under non_stress conditions, while knockdown plants display increased biomass.
 OsMPS expression is induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) but is repressed by auxin, gibberellin and brassinolide.
 Growth retardation caused by OsMPS overexpression is partially restored by auxin application.
 Expression profiling revealed that OsMPS negatively regulates the expression of EXPANSIN (EXP), cell wall biosynthesis as well as phytohormone signaling genes.
 Moreover, we demonstrate that OsMPS is a direct upstream regulator of OsEXPA4, OsEXPA8, OsEXPB2, OsEXPB3, OsEXPB6 and the endoglucanase genes OsGLU5 and OsGLU14.
 The multiple responses of OsMPS and its target genes to various hormones suggest an integrative function of OsMPS in the cross_talk between phytohormones and the environment to regulate  adaptive growth.
 OsCDT3 was mainly expressed in the roots and its expression was specifically induced by Al exposure, not by low pH and other metals.
 There was a small genotypic variation in OsCDT3 expression level, but no correlation between Al tolerance and the OsCDT3 variation was found among 17 rice cultivars.
Seed germination and innate immunity both have significant effects on plant life spans because they control the plant’s entry into the ecosystem and provide defenses against various external stresses, respectively.
 Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor_like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity.
 We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of a–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination.
 Yeast two_hybrid and co_immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OslecRK interacts with an actin_depolymerizing factor (ADF) in vivo via its kinase domain.
 Moreover, the rice adf mutant exhibited a reduced seed germination rate due to the suppression of a–amylase gene expression.
 The dual effects of OslecRK may be indicative of progressive adaptive evolution in rice.
 In this osstn8 mutant, PCPP was significantly suppressed, and the grana were thin and elongated.
 Upon HL illumination, PSII was strongly inactivated in the mutants, but the D1 protein was degraded more slowly than in wild_type, and mobilization of the PSII supercomplexes from the grana to the stromal lamellae for repair was also suppressed.
 Taken together, our current data show that the absence of STN8 is sufficient to abolish PCPP in osstn8 mutants and to produce all of the phenotypes observed in the double mutant of Arabidopsis, indicating the essential role of STN8_mediated PCPP in PSII repair.
 Although many enzymes and related factors have been identified for starch biosynthesis, unknown players remain to be identified, given that it is a complicated and sophisticated process.
 In the flo6 mutant, the starch content is decreased and the normal physicochemical features of starch are changed.
 Significantly, flo6 mutant endosperm cells show obvious defects in compound granule formation.
 Map_based cloning showed that FLO6 encodes a protein of unknown function.
 Furthermore, FLO6 can interact with isoamylase1 (ISA1) both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ISA1 does not bind to starch directly.
 We thus propose that FLO6 may act as a starch_binding protein involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation through a direct interaction with ISA1 in developing rice seeds.
 Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the effect of LT on seed germination and reproductive development in rice, the genetic component affecting vegetative growth under LT remains poorly understood.
 Here, we report that rice cultivars harboring the dominant LTG1 (Low Temperature Growth 1) allele are more tolerant to LT (15–25°C, a temperature range prevalent in high_altitude, temperate zones and high_latitude areas), than those with the ltg1 allele.
 Using a map_based cloning strategy, we show that LTG1 encodes a casein kinase I.
 A functional nucleotide polymorphism was identified in the coding region of LTG1, causing a single amino acid substitution (I357K) that is associated with the growth rate, heading date and yield of rice plants grown at LT.
 We present evidence that LTG1 affects rice growth at LT via an auxin_dependent process(es).
 Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of this locus suggests that the ltg1 haplotype arose before the domestication of rice in tropical climates.
 Together, our data demonstrate that LTG1 plays an important role in the adaptive growth and fitness of rice cultivars under conditions of low ambient temperature.
 Here, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L, osmogs mutant with shortened roots and isolated a gene that coded a putative mannosyl_oligosaccharide glucosidase (OsMOGS), an ortholog of a_glucosidase I in Arabidopsis, which trims the terminal glucosyl residue of the oligosaccharide chain of nascent peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
 OsMOGS is strongly expressed in rapidly cell_dividing tissues and OsMOGS protein is localized in the ER.
 Mutation of OsMOGS entirely blocked N_glycan maturation and inhibited high_mannose N_glycan formation.
 The osmogs mutant exhibited severe defects in root cell division and elongation, resulting in a short_root phenotype.
 In addition, osmogs plants had impaired root hair formation and elongation, and reduced root epidemic cell wall thickness due to decreased cellulose synthesis.
 Further analysis showed that auxin content and polar transport in osmogs roots were reduced due to incomplete N_glycosylation of the B subfamily of ATP_binding cassette transporter proteins (ABCBs).
 Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsMOGS in N_glycan formation is required for auxin_mediated root development in rice.
 Here, we show that rice OsPAD4 appears not to be the functional ortholog of AtPAD4 in host_pathogen interactions, and that the OsPAD4 encodes a plasma membrane protein but that AtPAD4 encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein.
 Suppression of OsPAD4 by RNA interference (RNAi) increased rice susceptibility to the biotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacteria blight disease in local tissue.
 The following results suggest that OsPAD4 functions differently than AtPAD4 in response to pathogen infection.
 First, OsPAD4 plays an important role in wound_induced systemic resistance, whereas AtPAD4 mediates systemic acquired resistance.
 Finally, OsPAD4 is required for the accumulation of terpenoid_type phytoalexin MOA in rice_bacterium interactions, but AtPAD4_mediated resistance is associated with the accumulation of indole_type phytoalexin camalexin.
 Here we report an ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER 1_like gene (OsETOL1) that modulates differentially drought and submergence tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L,.
 Two allelic mutants of OsETOL1 showed increased resistance to drought stress at the panicle development stage.
 Interestingly, the mutants exhibited a significantly slower growth rate under submergence stress at both the seedling and panicle development stages.
 Over_expression (OE) of OsETOL1 in rice resulted in reverse phenotypes when compared with the mutants.
 The OsETOL1 transcript was differentially responsive to abiotic stresses.
 OsETOL1 was found to interact with OsACS2, a homolog of 1_amino_cyclopropane_1_carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which acts as a rate_limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
 In the osacs2 mutant and OsETOL1_OE plants, ACC and ethylene content were decreased significantly, and exogenous ACC restored the phenotype of osetol1 and OsETOL1_OE to wild_type under submergence stress, implying a negative role for OsETOL1 in ethylene biosynthesis.
 The expression of several genes related to carbohydrate catabolism and fermentation showed significant changes in the osetol1 and OsETOL1_OE plants, implying that OsETOL1 may affect energy metabolism.
 These results together suggest that OsETOL1 plays distinct roles in drought and submergence tolerance by modulating ethylene production and energy metabolism.
 Findings from the expression and functional comparison of three ethylene overproducer (ETOL) family members in rice further supported the specific role of OsETOL1 in the responses to the two water stresses.
 To understand boron transport mechanisms in cereals, we characterized OsNIP3;1, a member of the major intrinsic protein family in rice (Oryza sativa L,, because OsNIP3;1 is the most similar rice gene to the Arabidopsis thaliana boric acid channel genes AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1.
 Yeast cells expressing OsNIP3;1 imported more boric acid than control cells.
 GFP_tagged OsNIP3;1 expressed in tobacco BY2 cells was localized to the plasma membrane.
 The accumulation of OsNIP3;1 transcript increased fivefold in roots within 6 h of the onset of boron starvation, but not in shoots.
 Promoter–GUS analysis suggested that OsNIP3;1 is expressed mainly in exodermal cells and steles in roots, as well as in cells around the vascular bundles in leaf sheaths and pericycle cells around the xylem in leaf blades.
 The growth of OsNIP3;1 RNAi plants was impaired under boron limitation.
 These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 functions as a boric acid channel, and is required for acclimation to boron limitation.
 Boron distribution among shoot tissues was altered in OsNIP3;1 knockdown plants, especially under boron_deficient conditions.
 This result demonstrates that OsNIP3;1 regulates boron distribution among shoot tissues, and that the correct boron distribution is crucial for plant growth.
 Analysis of many Arabidopsis mutants that were defective in auxin biosynthesis revealed that the indole_3_pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway, catalyzed by the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARA_BIDOPSIS (TAA) and YUCCA (YUC) families, is the major biosynthetic pathway of indole_3_acetic acid (IAA).
 In contrast, little information is known about the molecular mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis in rice.
 FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels.
 Moreover, we found that auxin sensitivity and polar transport activity were altered in the fib mutant.
 From these results, we suggest that FIB plays a pivotal role in IAA biosynthesis in rice and that auxin biosynthesis, transport and sensitivity are closely interrelated.
Members of the ATP Binding Cassette B/Multidrug_resistance/P_glycoprotein (ABCB/MDR/PGP) subfamily were shown to function primarily in auxin transport.
 Here, we describe that a knock_down of OsABCB14 confers decreased auxin concentrations and polar auxin transport rates, conferring insensitivity to 2,4_D and IAA.
 OsABCB14 displays enhanced specific auxin influx activity in yeast and protoplasts prepared from rice knock_down alleles.
 OsABCB14 is localized at the plasma membrane pointing to an important directionality under physiological conditions.
 osabcb14 mutants were surprisingly found to be insensitive to iron deficiency treatment (–Fe).
 Their Fe concentration is higher and up_regulation of Fe_deficiency responsive genes is lower in osabcb14 mutants than in wild type rice, Nipponbare (NIP).
 Taken together, our results strongly support the role of OsABCB14 as an This article is protected by copyright.
 The functional characterization of OsABCB14 provides insights in monocot auxin transport and its relationship to Fe nutrition.
 Here we use three imprinted genes, OsYUCCA11, yellow2_ like and ubiquitin hydrolase, to show that differential DNA methylation and tri_methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in the promoter and/or gene body influences allele_specific expression or the site of transcript initiation.
 Paternal expression of OsYUCCA11 required DNA methylation in the gene body whereas the gene body of the silenced maternal allele was hypomethylated and marked with H3K27me3.
 At yellow2_like, DNA hypomethylation in the upstream flanking region resulted in maternal transcripts that were longer than paternal transcripts; the maternal transcript initiation site was marked by DNA methylation in the paternal allele, and transcription initiated ~700 bp downstream.
 The paternal allele of an ubiquitin hydrolase gene exhibited gene body DNA methylation and produced full_length transcripts, while the maternal allele was hypomethylated in the 50 gene body and transcripts initiated from a downstream promoter.
 Inhibition of DNA methylation by 5_azacytidine or zebularine activated the long transcripts from yellow2_like and enhanced expression of the short transcripts from the ubiquitin hydrolase in seedlings, indicating that DNA methylation prevents transcript initiation from cryptic promoters.
 Here, the OsRAD51D gene was identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L,, a monocot model crop.
 In the rice genome, three alternative OsRAD51D mRNA splicing variants, OsRAD51D.
1 is a functional OsRAD51D protein in rice.
 Loss_of_function osrad51d mutant rice plants displayed normal vegetative growth.
 Homozygous osrad51d mutant flowers exhibited impaired development of lemma and palea and contained unusual numbers of stamens and stigmas.
 During early meiosis, osrad51d pollen mother cells (PMCs) failed to form normal homologous chromosome pairings.
 The osrad51d pollen cells contained numerous abnormal micro_nuclei that resulted in malfunctioning pollen.
 Under stagnant deoxygenated conditions, well suberized hypodermis developed in wild types but not in rcn1 mutants.
 The amount of the major aliphatic suberin monomers originating from C28 and C30 fatty acids or x_OH fatty acids was much lower in rcn1 than in the wild type.
 The GID2 gene encodes a putative F_boxprotein, which interacted with the rice Skp1 homolog in a yeast two_hybrid assay.
 In gid2, a repressor for GA signaling, SLR1, was highly accumulated in a phosphorylated form and GA increased its concentration, where_as SLR1 was rapidly degraded by GA through ubiquitination in the wild type.
 We conclude that GID2 is a positive regulator of GA signaling and that regulated degradation of SLR1 is initiated through GA_dependent phosphorylation and finalized by an SCFGID2_proteasome pathway.
 Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield.
 QTL pyramiding to combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits.
Loss of seed shattering was a key event in the domestication of major cereals.
 We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1_type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single_nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5¶ regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation.
 Pi21 encodes a proline_rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal–binding domain and putative protein_protein interaction motifs.
 Wild_type Pi21 appears to slow the plant’s defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms.
 Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor.
 The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide.
Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation that restricts gene flow between populations.
 We show that a killer_protector system at the S5 locus encoded by three tightly linked genes [Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) to ORF5] regulates fertility in indica_japonica hybrids.
The rice Xa2l gene, which confers resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae race 6, was isolated by positional cloning.
 Fifty transgenic rice plants carrying the cloned Xa21 gene display high levels of resistance to the pathogen.
 Characterization of Xa21 should facilitate understanding of plant disease resistance and lead to engineered resistance in rice.
 Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (OsCCaMK) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of OsCCaMK in rice symbiosis with bacteria.
 Here, we report the effect of a Tos17_induced OsCCaMK mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low_nitrogen (LN) and standard_nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild_type (WT) Nipponbare.
Soluble starch synthases (SSs) are major enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in developing rice (Oryza sativa L, endosperm.
 Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes.
 To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities.
 The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that SSIIa and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis.
 Collectively, the data showed that SSIIa and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis.
 In this study, OsSLI1 (Oryza sativa stress largely induced 1), encoding a member of the HD_Zip I subfamily, was isolated from rice.
 The expression of OsSLI1 was dramatically induced by multiple abiotic stresses and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA).
 The OsSLI1_GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cells and the transcriptional activity of OsSLI1 was confirmed by the yeast hybrid system.
 Further, it was found that OsSLI1 expression was enhanced in an ABI5_Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant abl1 under stress conditions, suggesting that ABL1 probably negatively regulates OsSLI1 gene expression.
 Moreover, it was found that OsSLI1 was regulated in panicle development.
 Taken together, OsSLI1 may be a transcriptional activator regulating stress_responsive gene expression and panicle development in rice.
We analyzed recessive mutants of two homeotic genes in rice, SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1) and DROOPING LEAF (DL).
 The homeotic mutation spw1 transforms stamens and lodicules into carpels and palea_like organs, respectively.
 Two spw1 alleles, spw1_1 and spw1_2, show the same floral phenotype and did not affect vegetative development.
 We show that SPW1 is a rice APETALA3 homolog, OsMADS16.
 In contrast, two strong alleles of the dl locus, drooping leaf_superman1 (dl_sup1) and drooping leaf_superman2 (dlsup2), cause the complete transformation of the gynoecium into stamens.
 All four dl alleles cause midrib_less drooping leaves.
 The flower of the double mutant, spw1 dl_sup, produces incompletely differentiated organs indefinitely after palea_like organs are produced in the position where lodicules are formed in the wild_type flower.
 Based on genetic and molecular results, we postulate a model of stamen and carpel specification in rice, with DL as a novel gene controlling carpel identity and acting mutually and antagonistically to the class B gene, SPW1.
 The fzp mutant phenotype suggests that FZP is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems within the spikelet meristem and permit the subsequent establishment of floral meristem identity.
 The FZP gene was isolated by transposon tagging.
 FZP encodes an ERF transcription factor and is the rice ortholog of the maize BD1 gene.
 Consistent with observations from phenotypic analyses, FZP expression was found to be restricted to the time of rudimentary glumes differentiation in a half_ring domain at the base of which the rudimentary glume primordium emerged.
The regulation of floral organ number is closely associated with floral meristem size.
 Mutations in the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) cause enlargement of the floral meristem in Oryza sativa (rice), resulting in an increase in the number of all floral organs.
 We isolated the FON1 gene by positional cloning and found that it encodes a leucine_rich repeat receptor_like kinase most similar to CLAVATA1 (CLV1) in Arabidopsis thaliana.
 Unlike CLV1, which is predominantly expressed in the L3 layer of the shoot meristem, FON1 is expressed throughout the whole floral meristem, suggesting that small modifications to the CLV signaling pathway may be required to maintain the floral meristem in rice.
 In addition, FON1 transcripts are detected in all meristems responsible for development of the aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional redundancy with FON1 act in the vegetative and inflorescence meristems to mask the effects of the fon1 mutation.
 We show here that RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), the closest homolog to Heading date 3a (Hd3a), is a major floral activator under LD conditions.
 The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects.
 Cytological analyses show that chiasma frequency is reduced dramatically in mer3 mutants and the remaining chiasmata distribute randomly among different pollen mother cells, implying possible coexistence of two kinds of crossover in rice.
 Immunocytological analyses reveal that MER3 only exists as foci in prophase I meiocytes.
 In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I.
 The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3.
 On the contrary, the absence of MER3 signal in pair2 mutants indicates that PAIR2 is essential for the loading and further function of MER3.
Dwarfism is a common type of mutation in many plant species.
 However, the genetic mechanisms controlling dwarfism are not well characterized, and the causal genes underlying most dwarf mutants are still uncovered.
 Here, we report a dominant mutant, Twisted dwarf 1_1 (Tid1_1), showing dwarfism and twisted growth in rice.
 Cells in the leaves of Tid1_1 are often ill_shapen, possibly owing to irregular cell division.
 Cell elongation in roots is suppressed in the elongation zone, and cells in the root apical meristem are enlarged.
 Map_based cloning of TID1 revealed that it encodes an a_tubulin protein comprising microtubules and is an ortholog of Arabidopsis LEFTY genes.
 The SRS1 gene is identical to the previously identified DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2).
 In the longitudinal direction of the lemma, both cell length and cell number are reduced in srs1_1 compared to the wild type, whereas in the lateral cross section of the lemma, cell length in srs1_1 is greater than that in the wild type, but the cell number in srs1_1 is the same as that in wild type.
 round seed phenotype of srs1_1 is due to the reduction in both cell length and cell number in the longitudinal direction, and the elongation of the cells in the lateral direction of the lemma.
 The SRS1 mRNA and proteins are abundant in wild type rice specifically in young organs, namely young leaves, internodes and panicles.
 Interestingly, the tissues expressing SRS1 are closely related to the tissues that exhibit abnormalities in the srs1 mutants.
 Detailed morphological analysis indicated that the th1 mutation caused a reduction in the size of tubercles, which are convex structures on the surface of the lemma and palea.
 By contrast, the number of tubercle rows and their spatial distribution on the lemma were not affected in the th1 mutant.
 Thus, the TH1 gene seems to be involved in fine_tuning the morphogenesis of the lemma and palea.
 In situ hybridization analysis revealed that TH1 was highly expressed in the primordia of the lemma and palea, but only weakly expressed in the primordia of the sterile lemma and rudimentary glume.
 We then examined the effect of th1 mutation on the lemma_like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants.
 The result showed that the th1 mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1.
 Here, we examined the role of FCP1 in leaf development.
 We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath.
 Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression.
 Spatial expression patterns of developmental genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsPINHEAD1 (OsPNH1) were severely affected in the FCP1_overexpressing shoots.
 Whereas DL was expressed in the central region of leaf primordia in control shoots, DL expression was expanded throughout the leaf primordia of the FCP1_overexpressing shoots in early developmental stages.
 By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression.
 Taken together, our results suggest that FCP1 is involved in the regulation of cell fate determination during leaf development.
 The loss_of_function mutants of DI8 designated as dI8_AD (Akibare waisei)， d18_Id18h (housetsu waisei)， and d18_dy (Waito_C) show severe dwarfism caused by the decrease of the level of active GA，GA1.
 To determine the possibility of reducing the height of rice through regulation of the level of active GA, we produced transgenic rice plants expressing the antisense of D18 cDNA.
 Plants expressing the antisense showed a semi_dwarf phenotype relative to the control plants carrying the vector only.
 The antisense plants with the semi_dwarf phenotype showed a reduced level of D18 mRNAIn contrast to the reduced level of DI8 mRNA, the plants induced a higher expression level of OsGA20oxI, which encodes GA 20_oxidase catalyzing the step from GAs3 to GA20 in the GA biosynthetic pathway.
 However, the rad gene had not been characterized.
 In the present study, we observed that, in the coleoptile, the AdhI mRNA levels were comparable between the rad mutant and the wild type cultivar Kinmaze, while the amount of ADHI protein was much lower in the rad mutant than in the wild type.
 Sequencing showed that G106 of the AdhI gene of Kinmaze was replaced with A in the rad mutant, resulting in an E36K substitution in the deduced amino acid sequence.
 A genotyping experiment using F2 plants from a cross of the rad mutant with the indica cultivar Kasalath indicated that the point mutation was involved in the repression of coleoptile elongation.
 Furthermore, since the reduced ADH activity appeared to cause an ATP deficiency, elongation of the coleoptile was repressed in the submerged rad mutant.
 LOX activity in rice seeds is localized in the bran fraction, and LOX_3 is the major isozyme component.
 We previously found that the Thai variety“Daw Dam”lacks LOX_3 protein and that LOX_3 null rice has less stale flavor during storage than normal LOX_3 rice.
 Thus, introduction of the LOX_3 null phenotype in mature seeds would facilitate the retention of high quality during storage.
 Although the LOX_3 null phenotype is inherited as a single recessive trait, the widely used screening method for LOX_3 null strains involves Western blotting with a progeny test that requires considerable time and effort.
 To develop a convenient LOX_3 null strain detection method, we performed linkage analysis between the LOX_3 null phenotype and restriction fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers using F2 progeny from“Daw Dam”" and“Nipponbare", and mapped the LOX_3 null phenotype between RM6736 and RM6329 on chromosome 3 containing three putative LOX genes.
 LOX_3 protein was purified using an affinity column bound with anti_LOX_3 monoclonal antibodies, and its amino acid sequences were determined.
 Based on these results, Os03g0700400 was confirmed to be the rice seed LOX_3 gene.
 Using these DNA sequence data, we developed a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and dot_blot_single nucleotide polymorphism analyses for screening and breeding LOX_3 null rice varieties.
 These methods are easy and cost_effective for screening LOX_3 null strains.
 To better understand genetic control of root hair formation in rice, we analyzed root hairless 1 (rth1) mutant that was induced by NaN3 treatment.
 SEM observation showed that in rth1 plants, root hair elongation was abolished after the formation of bulge.
 Sequences comparison of the three genes between wild_type Oochikara and rth1 detected a nucleotide substitution only in apyrase (OsAPY).
 This nucleotide substitution (G → A) lies in the junction between the third intron and the forth exon, and results in the splicing anomaly to the rth1 cDNA sequence.
 Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype.
 We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY.
 OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice.
Rice is unique among plants in that it accumulates major amounts of two types of seed storage proteins, prolamines and glutelins, which along with starch, serve as sources of carbon and nitrogen for the postgerminative seedling.
 In situ RT_PCR and fiuorescence microscopy revealed the glup4 mutant is impaired in glutelin mRNA localization to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum in developing endosperm cells.
Screening of rice full_length cDNA overexpressing (FOX) lines allowed the identification of a TIFY gene,TIFY11b，as a growth_promoting gene whose over_expression increased plant height and seed size.
 The grains of TIFY1 lb_overexpressing plants exceeded those of non_transformants in length, width and thickness, resulting in 9_ _21 % increases in grain weight.
 Although overexpression of TI_FY11b did not alter the photosynthetic rate per leaf area before and after heading, it caused an accumulation of higher levels of the carbohydrate assimilate, probably due to increased photosynthesis per plant, suggesting that the increase in grain size and weight is attained by enhanced accumulation and translocation of the carbohydrate in the culms and leaf sheaths of the transgenic plants.
 Thus, TIFY11b is a novel grain_size increasing gene.
 Here we found that OsJAR1 contributes mainly to stress induced JA_Ile production by the use of an osjar1 Tos17 mutant.
 The osjar1 mutant was impaired in JA_induced expression of JA _respon_sive genes and phy toalexin production, and these defects were restored genetically.
 The osjar1 mutant was also found to be more susceptible to the blast fungus than the parental wild type.
 The possible role of OsSBP in plant defense was evaluated by using a transgenic approach.
 Plants overexpressing OsSBP showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight.
 The expression of defense_related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the OsSBP overexpressors.
 These results suggest that the upregulation of OsSBP expression conferred enhanced tolerance to different pathogens, possibly by increasing plant sensitivity to endogenous defense responses.
 Additionally, the OsSBP protein might have a role in modulating the defense mechanism to biotic stress in rice.
 The rice (Oryza sativa L, XA21 receptor kinase is a key recognition and signaling determinant in the innate immune response.
 A yeast two_hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15).
 The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione_Stransferase (GST) pull_down and co_immunoprecipitation assays, respectively.
 XB15 fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli and from transgenic rice carry PP2C activity.
 Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal_ and dosage_dependent manner.
 A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding.
 Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis_related genes, and enhanced XA21_mediated resistance.
 Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21_mediated innate immune response.
 Controlling the expression level of OsAP2_39 which includes an APETALA 2 (AP2) domain leads to phenotypic changes in rice.
 Overexpression of OsAP2_39 leads to a reduction in yield by decreasing the biomass and the number of seeds in the transgenic rice lines.
 Global transcriptome analysis of the OsAP2_39 overexpression transgenic rice revealed the upregulation of a key Abscisic Acid (ABA) biosynthetic gene OsNCED_I which codes for 9_cis_epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and leads to an increase in the endogenous ABA level.
 The exogenous application of GA restores the wild_type phenotype in the transgenic line and ABA application induces the expression of EUI and suppresses the expression of OsAP2_39 in the wild_type line.
 In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that the expression of both OsNCED_1 and EUI are directly controlled by OsAP2_39.
 Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of the ABA/GA balance in rice which is regulated by OsAP2_39 that in turn regulates plant growth and seed production.
Rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog 1) is a key mediator of innate immunity.
 Over_expression of NH1 in rice results in resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae (Xoo), constitutive expression of defense related genes and enhanced benzothiadiazole (BTH)_ mediated cell death.
 Comparative genome hybridization and fine mapping rapidly identified the genomic location of the Snl6 gene.
 Snl6 is a member of the cinnamoyl_CoA reductase (CCR)_like gene family.
 We show that Snl6 is required for NH1_mediated resistance to Xoo.
 Further, we show that Snl6 is required for pathogenesis_related gene expression.
 In contrast to previously described CCR family members, disruption of Snl6 does not result in an obvious morphologic phenotype.
 Snl6 mutants have reduced lignin content and increased sugar extractability, an important trait for the production of cellulosic biofuels.
 These results suggest the existence of a conserved group of CCR_like genes involved in the defense response, and with the potential to alter lignin content without affecting development.
 Only Arabidopsis SWI1/DYAD and maize AM1, both of which are the coiled_coil protein, are known to be required for the initiation of plant meiosis.
 The mechanism underlying the synchrony of male meiosis, characteristic to flowering plants, has also been unclear in the plant kingdom.
 In other eukaryotes, RNA_recognition_motif (RRM) proteins are known to play essential roles in germ_cell development and meiosis progression.
 Rice MEL2 protein discovered in this study shows partial similarity with human proline_rich RRM protein, deleted in Azoospermia_Associated Protein1 (DAZAP1), though MEL2 also possesses ankyrin repeats and a RING finger motif.
 Expression analyses of several cell_cycle markers revealed that, in mel2 mutant anthers, most germ cells failed to enter premeiotic S_phase and meiosis, and a part escaped from the defect and underwent meiosis with a significant delay or continued mitotic cycles.
 Immunofluorescent detection revealed that T7 peptide_tagged MEL2 localized at cytoplasmic perinuclear region of germ cells during premeiotic interphase in transgenic rice plants.
 This study is the first report of the plant RRM protein, which is required for regulating the premeiotic G1/S_phase transition of male and female germ cells and also establishing synchrony of male meiosis.
 To gain insight into genes controlling photosynthetic capacity, we selected from our large T_DNA mutant population a rice stunted growth mutant with decreased carbon assimilate and yield production named photoassimilate defective1 (phd1).
 Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that PHD1 encodes a novel chloroplast_localized UDP_glucose epimerase (UGE), which is conserved in the plant kingdom.
 The chloroplast localization of PHD1 was confirmed by immunoblots, immunocytochemistry, and UGE activity in isolated chloroplasts, which was approximately 50% lower in the phd1_1 mutant than in the wild type.
 In addition, the amounts of UDP_glucose and UDP_galactose substrates in chloroplasts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, indicating that PHD1 was responsible for a major part of UGE activity in plastids.
 The relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane galactolipid, was decreased in the mutant, while the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) amount was not significantly altered, suggesting that PHD1 participates mainly in UDP_galactose supply for MGDG biosynthesis in chloroplasts.
 The phd1 mutant showed decreased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and altered chloroplast ultrastructure, suggesting that a correct amount of galactoglycerolipids and the ratio of glycolipids versus phospholipids are necessary for proper chloroplast function.
 Downregulated expression of starch biosynthesis genes and upregulated expression of sucrose cleavage genes might be a result of reduced photosynthetic activity and account for the decreased starch and sucrose levels seen in phd1 leaves.
 PHD1 overexpression increased photosynthetic efficiency, biomass, and grain production, suggesting that PHD1 plays an important role in supplying sufficient galactolipids to thylakoid membranes for proper chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity.
Land plants have evolved increasingly complex regulatory modes of their flowering time (or heading date in crops).
 Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4).
 ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long_day conditions.
 Map_based cloning revealed that Ehd4 encodes a novel CCCH_type zinc finger protein, which is localized to the nucleus and is able to bind to nucleic acids in vitro and transactivate transcription in yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional regulator.
 Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short_day and long_day conditions.
 We show that Ehd4 up_regulates the expression of the ‘‘florigen’’ genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators.
 Strikingly, Ehd4 is highly conserved in the Oryza genus including wild and cultivated rice, but has no homologs in other species, suggesting that Ehd4 is originated along with the diversification of the Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution.
 We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza_genus_specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice.
 However, the regulatory mechanism of cereal endosperm and seed development is largely unknown.
 We found that the OsFIE2 gene product was responsible for H3K27me3 production specifically in vivo.
 Genetic studies showed that a reduction of OsFIE2 expression led to smaller seeds, partially filled seeds, and partial loss of seed dormancy.
 Gene expression and proteomics analyses found that the starch synthesis rate limiting step enzyme and multiple storage proteins are down_regulated in OsFIE2 reduction lines.
 Our results suggest that OsFIE2_polycomb complex positively regulates rice endosperm development and grain filling via a mechanism highly different from that in Arabidopsis.
 Evidence also implicates D1 in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway.
 However, it is unclear how D1 functions in this pathway, because so far no partner has been identified to act with D1.
 In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U_box E3 ubiquitin ligase.
 Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment.
 Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs.
 Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1.
 Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BRsignaling pathway.
Unlike many wild grasses, domesticated rice cultivars have uniform culm height and panicle size among tillers and the main shoot, which is an important trait for grain yield.
 Most dwt1 mutant plants develop main shoots with normal height and larger panicles, but dwarf tillers bearing smaller panicles compared with those of the wild type.
 In addition, dwt1 tillers have shorter internodes with fewer and un_elongated cells compared with the wild type, indicating that DWT1 affects cell division and cell elongation.
 Map_based cloning revealed that DWT1 encodes a WUSCHEL_related homeobox (WOX) transcription factor homologous to the Arabidopsis WOX8 and WOX9.
 The DWT1 gene is highly expressed in young panicles, but undetectable in the internodes, suggesting that DWT1 expression is spatially or temporally separated from its effect on the internode growth.
 Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell division and cell elongation, cytokinin/gibberellin homeostasis and signaling in dwt1 shorter internodes.
 Moreover, the non_elongating internodes of dwt1 are insensitive to exogenous gibberellin (GA) treatment, and some of the slender rice1 (slr1) dwt1 double mutant exhibits defective internodes similar to the dwt1 single mutant, suggesting that the DWT1 activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with GA signaling.
 Here we describe a novel CCCH_type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativa leaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture.
 OsLIC encoded an ancestral and unique CCCH type zinc finge protein.
 Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice.
 OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud.
 Genetic analysis suggested that OsLIC is epistatic to d2_1, whereas d61_1 is epistatic to OsLIC.
 Moreover, transcription of OsLIC was induced by 24_epibrassinolide.
 OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture.
 Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10_suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease.
 Here we report the in vivo interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP3 with the rice XA21 PRR, which confers resistance to the Gram negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
 We show that XA21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM).
 In BiP3_overexpressing rice plants, XA21_mediated immunity is compromised, XA21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited.
 BiP3 overexpression does not affect the general rice defense response, cell death or brassinolide_induced responses.
 These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance to Xoo.
 In this study, by using RNAi transgenic rice, we further demonstrate that NOA1 functions in a temperature_dependent manner to regulate chlorophyll and Rubisco levels.
 When plants were grown at 30uC, the chlorophyll and Rubisco levels in OsNOA1_silenced plants were only slightly lower than those in WT.
 Here, we further identified two novel Spo11/TopVIA homologues (named OsSpo11_4 and OsSpo11_5, respectively) that exist just in the monocot model plant Oryza sativa, indicating that at least five Spo11/TopVIA homologues are present in the rice genome.
 The results showed that OsSpo11_4 and OsTopVIB can self_interact strongly and among the 3 examined OsSpo11 proteins, only OsSpo11_4 interacted with OsTopVIB.
 Pull_down assay confirmed the interaction between OsSpo11_4 and OsTopVIB, which indicates that OsSpo11_4 may interact with OsTopVIB in vivo.
 Further in vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that among the above 4 proteins, only OsSpo11_4 exhibited double_strand DNA cleavage activity and its enzymatic activity appears dependent on Mg2+ and independent of OsTopVIB, despite its interaction with OsTopVIB.
 We further analyzed the biological function of OsSpo11_4 by RNA interference and found that down_regulated expression of OsSpo11_4 led to defects in male meiosis, indicating OsSpo11_4 is required for meiosis.
 To study the function of chromatin regulators in hybrid gene expression, the histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1 whose expression displayed a circadian rhythm was over_expressed or inactivated by RNAi in an elite rice parent.
 Increased OsHDT1 expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid.
 Nonadditive up_regulation of key flowering time genes was found to be related to flowering time of the hybrid.
 Over_expression of OsHDT1 repressed the nonadditive expression of the key flowering repressors in the hybrid (i.
 OsGI and Hd1) inducing early flowering.
 Analysis of histone acetylation suggested that OsHDT1 over_expression might promote deacetylation on OsGI and Hd1 chromatin during the peak expression phase.
 High throughput differential gene expression analysis revealed that altered OsHDT1 levels affected nonadditive expression of many genes in the hybrid.
 These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that OsHDT1 level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that OsHDT1 may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression.
 In the present research, we report the transcriptional regulation of a novel rice ethylene response factor (ERF) in ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance.
 Transgenic plants overexpressing OsDERF1 (OE) led to reduced tolerance to drought stress in rice at seedling stage, while knockdown of OsDERF1 (RI) expression conferred enhanced tolerance at seedling and tillering stages.
 To elucidate the molecular basis of drought tolerance, we identified the target genes of OsDERF1 using the Affymetrix GeneChip, including the activation of cluster stress_related negative regulators such as ERF repressors.
 Biochemical and molecular approaches showed that OsDERF1 at least directly interacted with the GCC box in the promoters of ERF repressors OsERF3 and OsAP2_39.
 We silenced OsCOI1 in rice plants via RNA interference (RNAi) to determine the role of OsCOI1 in rice defense against rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, a chewing insect, and brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a phloem_feeding insect.
 In wild_type rice plants (WT), the transcripts of OsCOI1 were strongly and continuously up_regulated by LF infestation and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, but not by BPH infestation.
 The RNAi lines with repressed expression of OsCOI1 showed reduced resistance against LF, but no change against BPH.
 Silencing OsCOI1 did not alter LF_induced LOX activity and JA content, but it led to a reduction in the TrypPI content, POD and PPO activity by 62.
2% in OsCOI1 RNAi plants.
 These results suggest that OsCOI1 is an indispensable signaling component, controlling JA_regulated defense against chewing insect (LF) in rice plants, and COI1 is also required for induction of TrypPI, POD and PPO in rice defense response to LF infestation.
 Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3_1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3_2 in rice heading.
 Our results suggest OsELF3_1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression.
 In addition, OsELF3_1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short_day (SD) conditions.
 Moreover, OsELF3_1 suppresses a flowering repressor GRAIN NUMBER, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long_day (LD) conditions.
 Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3_1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
 In this report, a LEA protein producing full_length gene OsLEA3_2 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa) using the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) method.
 OsLEA3_2 was found to be only expressed in the embryo and can be induced by abiotic stresses.
 The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3_2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt_ and osmotic_stress conditions.
 OsLEA3_2 was also inserted into pHB vector and overexpressed in Arabidopsis and rice.
 In vitro analysis showed that OsLEA3_2 was able to protect LDH from aggregation on freezing and inactivation on desiccation.
 These results indicated that OsLEA3_2 plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses.
 Previous studies have shown that Bsister genes from eudicots are involved in cell differentiation during ovule and seed development.
 Our analyses show that OsMADS29 is expressed in female reproductive organs including the ovule, ovule vasculature, and the whole seed except for the outer layer cells of the pericarp.
 Knock_down of OsMADS29 by double_stranded RNA_mediated interference (RNAi) results in shriveled and/or aborted seeds.
 Our results suggest that OsMADS29 has important functions in seed development of rice by regulating cell degeneration of maternal tissues.
 Here, we show that OsMYB55 is induced by high temperature and overexpression of OsMYB55 resulted in improved plant growth under high temperature and decreased the negative effect of high temperature on grain yield.
 We demonstrate that OsMYB55 binds to the promoter regions of target genes and directly activates expression of some of those genes including glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;2) glutamine amidotransferase (GAT1) and glutamate decarboxylase 3 (GAD3).
 OsMYB55 overexpression resulted in an increase in total amino acid content and of the individual amino acids produced by the activation of the above mentioned genes and known for their roles in stress tolerance, namely L_glutamic acid, GABA and arginine especially under high temperature condition.
 In conclusion, overexpression of OsMYB55 improves rice plant tolerance to high temperature, and this high tolerance is associated with enhanced amino acid metabolism through transcription activation.
The ankyrin repeat_containing protein gene OsPIANK1 (AK068021) in rice (Oryza sativa L, was previously shown to be upregulated following infection with the rice leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo).
 In this study, we further characterized the role of OsPIANK1 in basal defense against Magnaporthe oryzae (M.
oryzae) by 59 deletion analysis of its promoter and overexpression of the gene.
 The promoter of OsPIANK1 with 1,985 bps in length was sufficient to induce the OsPIANK1 response to inoculation with M.
oryzae and to exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA), but not to exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA).
 A TCA_element present in the region between 2563 bp and 2249 bp may be responsible for the OsPIANK1 response to both M.
oryzae infection and exogenous SA application.
 The JERE box, CGTCA_box, and two MYB binding sites locating in the region between 21985 bp and 2907 bp may be responsible for the response of OsPIANK1 to exogenous MeJA.
 OsPIANK1 expression was upregulated after inoculation with M.
oryzae and after treatment with exogenous SA and MeJA.
 Overexpression of OsPIANK1 enhanced resistance of rice to M.
oryzae, although it did not confer complete resistance.
oryzae was accompanied by enhanced transcriptional expression of SA_ and JA_dependent genes such as NH1, WKRY13, PAL, AOS2, PR1b, and PR5.
 This evidence suggests that OsPIANK1 acted as a positive regulator in rice basal defense mediated by SA_ and JA_signaling pathways.
Using inverse genetics approach, we characterized the function of a rice (Oryza sativa L, vacuolar H+ _ATPase subunit A(OsVHA_A) gene in stomatal conductance regulation and physiological response to salt and osmotic stress.
 OsVHA_A was constitutively expressed in different rice tissues, and the fusion protein of GFP_OsVHA_A was exclusively targeted to tonoplast when transiently expressed in the onion epidermal cells.
 Heterologous expression of OsVHA_A was able to rescue the yeast mutant vma1D (lacking subunit A activity) phenotype, suggesting that it partially restores the activity of V_ATPase.
 Meanwhile, RNAi_directed knockdown of OsVHA_A led to a reduction of vacuolar H+ _ATPase activity and an enhancement of plasma membrane H+_ATPase activity, thereby increasing the concentrations of extracellular H+ and intracellular K+ and Na+ under stress conditions.
 Knockdown of OsVHA_A also resulted in the upregulation of PAM3 (plasma membrane H+_ATPase 3) and downregulation of CAM1 (calmodulin 1), CAM3 (calmodulin 3) and YDA1 (YODA, a MAPKK gene).
 Altered level of the ion concentration and the gene expression by knockdown of OsVHA_A probably resulted in expanded aperture of stomatal pores and increased stomatal density.
 In addition, OsVHA_A RNAi plants displayed significant growth inhibition under salt and osmotic stress conditions.
 Taken together, our results suggest that OsVHA_A takes part in regulating stomatal density and opening via interfering with pH value and ionic equilibrium in guard cells and thereby affects the growth of rice plants.
 oryzae (Xoo) is spread systemically through the xylem tissue and causes bacterial blight in rice.
 Two rice proteins, OsVOZ2 and a putative thiamine synthase (OsXNP), were identified as targets of XopNKXO85 by yeast two_hybrid screening.
 Interactions between XopNKXO85 and OsVOZ2 and OsXNP were further confirmed in planta by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vivo pull_down assays.
 To investigate the roles of OsVOZ2 in interactions between rice and Xoo, we evaluated the virulence of the wild_type KXO85 and xopNKXO85 mutant in the OsVOZ2 mutant line PFG_3A_07565 of Dongjin.
 These results indicate that XopNKXO85 and OsVOZ2 play important roles both individually and together for Xoo virulence in rice.
 Map_based cloning of LYL1 revealed that it encodes a geranylgeranyl reductase.
 The mutation of LYL1 led to the majority of Chl molecules are conjugated with an unsaturated geranylgeraniol side chain.
 LYL1 is the firstly defined gene involved in the reduction step from Chl_geranylgeranylated (ChlGG) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to Chl_phytol (ChlPhy) and phytyl pyrophosphate (PPP) in rice.
 LYL1 can be induced by light and suppressed by darkness which is consistent with its potential biological functions.
 We concluded that LYL1 also plays an important role in response to high_light in rice.
In rice (Oryza sativa L,, there is a diversity in flowering time that is strictly genetically regulated.
 Here, we demonstrate that functional defects in the florigen gene RFT1 are the main cause of late flowering in an indica cultivar, Nona Bokra.
 Mapping and complementation studies revealed that sequence polymorphisms in the RFT1 regulatory and coding regions are likely to cause late flowering under long_day conditions.
 Sequencing of the RFT1 region in rice accessions from a global collection showed that the E105K mutation is found only in indica, and indicated a strong association between the RFT1 haplotype and extremely late flowering in a functional Hd1 background.
 Furthermore, SNPs in the regulatory region of RFT1 and the E105K substitution in 1,397 accessions show strong linkage disequilibrium with a flowering time–associated SNP.
 Although the defective E105K allele of RFT1 (but not of another florigen gene, Hd3a) is found in many cultivars, relative rate tests revealed no evidence for differential rate of evolution of these genes.
 The ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions suggest that the E105K mutation resulting in the defect in RFT1 occurred relatively recently.
 These findings indicate that natural mutations in RFT1 provide flowering time divergence under long_day conditions.
 In this work, we investigated the possible biological role of the root_specific a_expansin gene OsEXPA8 in rice growth and development by generating transgenic plants.
 Overexpression of OsEXPA8 in rice plants yielded pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture (longer primary roots, more lateral roots and root hairs), increased plant height, enhanced leaf number and enlarged leaf size.
 Further study indicated that the average cell length in both leaf and root vascular bundles was enhanced, and the cell growth in suspension cultures was increased, which.
 Our previous work showed that constitutive overexpression of OsSPX1 in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants improved cold tolerance while also decreasing total leaf Pi.
 In the present study, we generated rice antisense and sense transgenic lines of OsSPX1 and found that down_regulation of OsSPX1 caused high sensitivity to cold and oxidative stresses in rice seedlings.
 Our study indicated that OsSPX1 may be involved in cross_talks between oxidative stress, cold stress and phosphate homeostasis in rice seedling leaves.
 indica cultivar 3037) semi_dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map_based cloning and a complementation test.
 A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant.
 Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division_related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant.
 In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height.
 These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice.
 In rice (Oryza sativa L,, a facultative short_day plant, numerous flowering time and flower formation genes that control floral transition have been identified and their physiological effects and biochemical functions have been clarified.
 In the present study, we used a Se14_deficient mutant line (HS112) and other flowering mutant lines to investigate the photoperiodic response, chromosomal location and function in the photoperiod sensitivity of the Se14 gene.
 We also studied the interactive effects of this locus with other crucial flowering time genes.
 We found that Se14 is independent of the known photoperiod_sensitive genes, such as Hd1 and Ghd7, and is identical to Os03g0151300, which encodes a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain_containing protein.
 Expression analysis revealed that the expressions of RFT1, a floral initiator known as a ‘‘florigen_like gene’’, and Ehd1 were up_regulated in HS112, whereas this up_regulation was not observed in the original variety of ‘Gimbozu’.
 ChIP assays of the methylation states of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) revealed that the trimethylated H3K4 in the promoter region of the RFT1 chromatin was significantly increased in HS112.
 We conclude that Se14 is a novel photoperiod_sensitivity gene that has a suppressive effect on floral transition (flowering time) under long day_length conditions through the modification of chromatin structure by H3K4me3 demethylation in the promoter region of RFT1.
 The altered cell wall C_partitioning during N_limitation in the OsUGE1_OX lines appears to be mediated by OsUGE1 via the repression of the cellulose synthesis associated genes, OsSus1, OsCesA4, 7, and 9.
 However, a direct relationship between OsUGE1 and cell wall C_partitioning during N_limitation requires further investigation.
 In the present study, we investigated the roles of rice RACK1A gene (OsRACK1A) in controlling seed germination and its molecular mechanisms by generating a series of transgenic rice lines, of which OsRACK1A was either over_expressed or under_expressed.
 Our results showed that OsRACK1A positively regulated seed germination and negatively regulated the responses of seed germination to both exogenous ABA and H2O2.
 ABA inhibition on seed germination was almost fully recovered by exogenous H2O2 treatment.
 It is concluded that OsRACK1A positively regulates seed germination by controlling endogenous levels of ABA and H2O2 and their interaction.
Flowering time and plant height are important agronomic traits for crop production.
 The dlf1 mutation suppressed the transcription of Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 and its downstream flowering_time genes including Hd1, Ehd1 and Hd3a under both long_day (LD) and short_day (SD) conditions.
 We conclude that Dlf1 acts as a transactivator to downregulate Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 in the signal transduction pathway of flowering and plays an important role in the regulation of plant height in rice.
 Analysis of OsWRKY42_GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor.
 OsWRKY42_overexpressing (OsWR KY42OX) transgenic rice plants exhibited an early leaf senescence phenotype with accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and a reduced chlorophyll content.
Plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) are essential for ribosome biogenesis, plastid protein biosynthesis, chloroplast differentiation, and early chloroplast development.
 This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage.
 This albino phenotype was associated with altered chlorophyll (Chl) content and chloroplast development.
 Map_based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast.
 ASL1 showed tissue_specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues.
 In addition, ASL1 expression was regulated by light.
 The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable.
 Our findings indicate that nuclear_encoded PRPS20 plays an important role in chloroplast development in rice.
 Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the qUVR_10 locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele.
 High_resolution mapping using 1850 F2 plants enabled us to delimit qUVR_10 to a ,27_kb genomic region.
 Activity of CPD photorepair in Nipponbare was higher than that of Kasalath and nearly isogenic with qUVR_10 [NIL(qUVR_10)], suggesting that the CPD photolyase of Kasalath was defective.
 Transgenic plants showed the same level of resistance as Nipponbare did, indicating that the qUVR_10 encoded the CPD photolyase.
 Comparison of the qUVR_10 sequence in the Nipponbare and Kasalath alleles revealed one probable candidate for the functional nucleotide polymorphism.
The broad_spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was cloned using a map_based cloning strategy.
 Sequencing of a 76_kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Pi9 locus led to identification of six tandemly arranged resistance_like genes with a nucleotide_binding site (NBS) and leucine_rich repeats (LRRs) (Nbs1_Pi9–Nbs6_Pi9).
 Analysis of selected Pi9 deletion mutants and transformation of a 45_kb fragment from the BAC contig into the susceptible rice cultivar TP309 narrowed down Pi9 to the candidate genes Nbs2_Pi9 and Nbs3_Pi9.
 Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2_Pi9 is the Pi9 gene.
 Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the six paralogs at the Pi9 locus belong to four classes and gene duplication might be one of the major evolutionary forces contributing to the formation of the NBS–LRR gene cluster.
 Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)– PCR analysis showed that Pi9 was constitutively expressed in the Pi9_resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection.
 The cloned Pi9 gene provides a starting point to elucidate the molecular basis of the broad_spectrum disease resistance and the evolutionary mechanisms of blast resistance gene clusters in rice.
 These four candidates for Pi37 (Pi37_1, _2, _3, and _4) were amplified separately from St.
 Pi37 encodes a 1290 peptide NBS–LRR product, and the presence of substitutions at two sites in the NBS region (V239A and I247M) is associated with the resistance phenotype.
 1, Pi37 was constitutively expressed and only slightly induced by blast infection.
 Transient expression experiments indicated that the Pi37 product is restricted to the cytoplasm.
 The four Pi37 paralogs are more closely related to maize rp1 than to any of the currently isolated rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, Pi2, Piz_t, and Pi36.
The rice blast resistance gene Pikm was cloned by a map_based cloning strategy.
 Instead, it was revealed that transgenic lines carrying both of these genes expressed blast resistance.
Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice.
 oryzae, we cloned the resistance (R) gene at this locus using a map_based cloning strategy.
 Sequence analysis of this genomic region identified two candidate genes, Pi5_1 and Pi5_2, which encode proteins carrying three motifs characteristic of R genes.
 The two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L,, indica and japonica, have shown obvious differences in rice blast resistance, but the genomic basis that underlies the difference is not clear.
 Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, Pid3, in the indica variety, Digu.
 The allelic Pid3 loci in most of the tested japonica varieties were identified as pseudogenes due to a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2208 starting from the translation initiation site.
 These results suggest that the pseudogenization of Pid3 in japonica occurred after the divergence of indica and japonica.
Seed dormancy has been associated with red grain color in cereal crops for a century.
 The association was linked to qSD7_ 1/qPC7, a cluster of quantitative trait loci for seed dormancy/pericarp color in weedy red rice.
 This research delimited qSD7_1/qPC7 to the Os07g11020 or Rc locus encoding a basic helix_loop_helix family transcription factor by intragenic recombinants and provided unambiguous evidence that the association arises from pleiotropy.
 Of the pleiotropic effects, seed dormancy could contribute most to the weed adaptation.
 Pleiotropy prevents the use of the dormancy gene to improve resistance of white pericarp cultivars against pre_harvest sprouting through conventional breeding approaches.
 Here, we characterized a rice clustered_spikelet mutant, sped1_D, with shortened pedicels and/or secondary branches, which exhibits decreased pollen fertility.
 In addition, we analyzed the expression of genes that function in floral meristems and found that RFL and WOX3 were severely downregulated in sped1_D.
 The present study reports pdhk gene downregulation effects on maturation time of a late maturing, aromatic, native indica rice {Oryza sativa L, cultivar, Badshahbhog.
 A double_stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA)_mediated gene silencing strategy was used to downregulate rice mitochondrial pdhk gene expression.
 Northern blot, reverse transcription_polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), and real_time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses provided evidence for endogenous pdhk gene downregulation in T^, T^, and Tj generations of transgenic rice lines.
 These results provided evidence for stable pdhk gene downregulation throughout filial generations.
 It was further observed that transgenic lines with two insertion events of transferred dsRNA effected more downregulation of pdhk gene expression relative to rice lines carrying a single dsRNA insertion.
 Repression of OsEXPA3 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) in rice (Oryza sativa L, severely impaired the growth of the root system.
 A significant reduction in the primary root length and lateral root density was observed in 1_wk_old OsEXPA3_RNAi lines at seedling stage, and the total size and density of the root system was clearly decreased in 1_mo_old plants.
 Further study indicated that the cell length of root vascular bundles and cell growth in suspension cultures in OsEXPA3_RNAi lines decreased significantly, which revealed the cellular basis for OsEXPA3_mediated rice root growth.
 Further, the cell_wall mechanical properties of suspension cells probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that repression of OsEXPA3 led to a significant increase in cell_wall stiffness, and cell_wall polymer compositions revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were also strongly changed.
 Taken together, the results suggest that OsEXPA3 is required for root system development in rice and involved in mediating root growth by mediating cell_wall loosenin.
Plant height is one of the most important traits in crop improvement.
 Therefore revealing the mechanism of plant elongation and controlling plant height in accordance with breeding object is important.
 ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers.
 ssd1 also shows abnormal cell  files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant.
 Map_based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant_specific protein with unknown biochemical function.
 Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants.
 It is reported that auxin plays an important role in the formation of crown roots, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown.
 We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa L, mutant crown rootless4 (crl4) that was found to have defective crown root formation.
 Besides reduced crown root number, the crl4 mutant showed auxin_related abnormal phenotypical characteristics such as reduced lateral root number and impaired root gravitropism.
 CRL4 encodes a protein highly homologous with Arabidopsis GNOM, which mediates auxin_dependent plant growth by coordinating the polar localization of auxin efflux carrier PIN1.
 In the crl4 mutant, auxin transport was impaired in shoots and roots.
  Besides, the GUS staining controlled by DR5 promoter in the node of crl4 mutant was fainter and spread wider than that of wild_type.
 These results indicate that maintaining an appropriate auxin accumulation and gradient through CRL4 in the basal portion of shoots is essential for crown root formation in rice.
 sativa plants infected with other rice viruses in previous studies indicated that the suppression of the expansin 1 gene is likely to be a signature response commonly associated with virus_induced stunting of Oryza species.
 In our previous work on rice seed germination, we identified a B12D_like protein encoded by LOC_Os7g41350 (named OsB12D1).
 OsB12D1 pertains to an ancient protein family with an amino acid sequence highly conserved from moss to angiosperms.
 Among the six OsB12Ds, OsB12D1 is one of the major transcripts and is primarily expressed in germinating seed and root.
 Bioinformatics analyses indicated that OsB12D1 is an anoxic or submergence resistance_related gene.
 RT_PCR results showed OsB12D1 is induced remarkably in the coleoptiles or roots by flooding during seed germination and early seedling growth.
 Moreover, this tolerance was not affected by the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol.
 OsB12D1 was identified in the mitochondrion by subcellular localization analysis and possibly enhances electron transport through mediating Fe and oxygen availability under flooded conditions.
 This work indicated that OsB12D1 is a promising gene that can help to enhance  rice seedling establishment in farming practices, especially for direct seeding.
 In this study, we generated transgenic rice over_expressing OsHsfA7 and carried out morphological observation and stress tolerance assays.
 Under salt treatment, over_expressing OsHsfA7 rice showed alleviative appearance of damage symptoms and higher survival rate, leaf electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content of transgenic plants were lower than those of wild type plants.
 These findings indicate that over_expression of OsHsfA7 gene can increase tolerance to salt and drought stresses in rice seedlings.
We characterized a rice monoculm mutant moc2, which showed significantly reduced tiller numbers, pale_green leaves, a reduced growth rate, and a consequent dwarf phenotype.
 The monoculm feature was attributed to a deficiency in the efficient outgrowth of tiller buds, although the moc2 mutant produced tiller buds.
 Inconsistent change was observed in the expression of genes involved in tiller bud outgrowth, suggesting that the moc2 mutant has a defective function necessary for the tiller bud outgrowth.
 The gene responsible for the moc2 mutant was mapped to a locus encoding cytosolic fructose_1,6_bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), in which a Tos17 retrotransposon was inserted in exon 4.
 Reverse_transcription PCR for the FBP1 gene amplified a shorter transcript from the moc2 mutant than from the wild_type plant.
 The moc2 mutant showed a very low level of FBPase activity, suggesting that it involves a loss_of_function mutation of FBP1.
 Defective FBPase activity is anticipated to lead a shortage of sucrose supply, which probably causes the inhibition of tiller bud outgrowth in the moc2 mutant.
 The monoculm phenotype of the moc2 mutant supports the idea that sucrose supply may be an important cue to outgrow tiller buds.
The RPN10 subunit is a component of the 19S regulatory complex that is essential for the ubiquitin_dependent proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome (EC 3.
 OsrbohA and OsrbohD transcripts were induced after inoculation with an incompatible N1141 strain of Acidovorax avenae, whereas OsrbohaB and OsrbohE mRNA levels did not obviously change even after inoculation with the incompatible strain.
 OsrbohA and OsrbohE knockdown lines showed that rapid H2O2 generation is caused by OsrbohA, whereas OsrbohE is involved in late H2O2 production during the immune response.
 Hypersensitive cell death was decreased only in the OsrbohA knockdown line.
 We further demonstrated that among immune related genes, the induction of EL2 and LOX genes is controlled by ROS generated by OsrbohE, whereas expression of Cht_1 gene is regulated by both OsrbohA and OsrbohE.
 These results indicate that the ROS molecules generated by OsrbohA and OsrbohE regulate different signaling pathways in the plant immune response.
 Here we report that the du3 mutant has also reduced the splicing efficiency of Wxb pre_mRNA.
 Furthermore, map_based cloning revealed that Du3 encodes the rice homolog of a cap_binding protein 20 kD subunit (CBP20), a component of the heterodimeric nuclear cap_binding complex (CBC) playing a role in pre_mRNA splicing, RNA nuclear export, and nonsense_mediated decay.
 Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)_tagged Du3 proteins in rice protoplasts resulted in localization to the nucleus showing a speckled pattern similar to the pattern displayed by other splicing factors.
